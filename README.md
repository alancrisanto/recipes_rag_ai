# Recipes Generator

This project is a **Recipe Recommendation Application** built using **Gradio** and a custom `get_recipe` model. The application allows users to ask for recipe suggestions based on ingredients, dietary preferences, or specific instructions.

## Features

- **Recipe Recommendations**: Users can ask for recipes based on specific ingredients or preferences (e.g., "Low-calorie chicken recipe").
- **Interactive Chat Interface**: Users interact with the application via a chatbot-like interface.
- **Custom Recipe Suggestions**: The core logic is handled by a `get_recipe` function, which processes user inputs to generate recipe suggestions.
