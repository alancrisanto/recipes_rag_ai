      "  instructions: Make the dough in astand mixer. Combine the flour, salt, sugar and 20g softened butter. Dissolve the yeast in around 80ml tepid water, around 38C, not too hot or it will kill the yeast. Add 20g of beaten egg and the milk to the stand mixer bowl. Pour in the yeast-water mixture and turn on to a low speed with a dough hook attachment for approximately 5 mins until the dough comes together to form a rough ball. Increase the speed to medium-high and knead for a further 6-10 mins until the dough is smooth. The exact time will depend on your stand mixer. Wrap the dough tightly and rest at room temperature for 10 mins. Unwrap and roll out the dough into a rectangle around 4mm thick, about 40 x 30cm. Wrap the dough rectangle and put in the freezer for 1 hr to rest or in the fridge overnight. Meanwhile, on a sheet of baking parchment, shape the remaining 200g butter into a flat rectangle (about 20 x 30cm) using a rolling pin. It should be around half the length of your dough rectangle, but the same width. Put in the fridge until needed – you want it to be cold but flexible. Take the chilled dough out of the fridge or freezer and lay the butter in the centre. Fold the dough edges in to meet at the centre, covering the butter. Rotate the dough 90 degrees and roll it out to about 40cm in length, keeping the same width. Handle the dough gently and return it to the fridge for 10-20 mins if it starts getting too warm. Repeat the process of folding the edges of the dough into the middle, then fold it over on itself again like a book (this is known as a double turn). Chill for 30 mins. Rotate the dough 90 degrees again. Roll it out long again and fold the edges in to meet in the middle. Chill for a further 30 mins. Roll out the dough to 32 x 30cm and cut 8 rectangles, 8 x 15cm each. Put a chocolate baton on one long edge of each rectangle, fold the dough inwards, then put the second chocolate baton next to the folded dough and roll the dough around the encase the chocolate, with the seams of the dough now facing down. Prove the pain au chocolat at 26-29°C (this is really important as proving at any higher temperature will mean the butter between the layers melts) for around 2-3 hrs, until doubled in size. Heat the oven to 175C/155C fan/gas 4, brush the pain au chocolat with the remaining egg and bake for 15-18 mins until golden brown and cooked through.Best eaten on the day butwill keep in an airtight container for two days.\n",

      "Ingredients: 420gplain flour, 8gsea salt, 60gcaster sugar, 220gunsalted butter(at least 82% fat works best), 20g softened, 20gfresh yeast, or 10g dried yeast, 1egg, beaten, 110mlwhole milk, 16dark chocolate batons\n",
      "Instructions: Make the dough in astand mixer. Combine the flour, salt, sugar and 20g softened butter. Dissolve the yeast in around 80ml tepid water, around 38C, not too hot or it will kill the yeast. Add 20g of beaten egg and the milk to the stand mixer bowl. Pour in the yeast-water mixture and turn on to a low speed with a dough hook attachment for approximately 5 mins until the dough comes together to form a rough ball. Increase the speed to medium-high and knead for a further 6-10 mins until the dough is smooth. The exact time will depend on your stand mixer. Wrap the dough tightly and rest at room temperature for 10 mins. Unwrap and roll out the dough into a rectangle around 4mm thick, about 40 x 30cm. Wrap the dough rectangle and put in the freezer for 1 hr to rest or in the fridge overnight. Meanwhile, on a sheet of baking parchment, shape the remaining 200g butter into a flat rectangle (about 20 x 30cm) using a rolling pin. It should be around half the length of your dough rectangle, but the same width. Put in the fridge until needed – you want it to be cold but flexible. Take the chilled dough out of the fridge or freezer and lay the butter in the centre. Fold the dough edges in to meet at the centre, covering the butter. Rotate the dough 90 degrees and roll it out to about 40cm in length, keeping the same width. Handle the dough gently and return it to the fridge for 10-20 mins if it starts getting too warm. Repeat the process of folding the edges of the dough into the middle, then fold it over on itself again like a book (this is known as a double turn). Chill for 30 mins. Rotate the dough 90 degrees again. Roll it out long again and fold the edges in to meet in the middle. Chill for a further 30 mins. Roll out the dough to 32 x 30cm and cut 8 rectangles, 8 x 15cm each. Put a chocolate baton on one long edge of each rectangle, fold the dough inwards, then put the second chocolate baton next to the folded dough and roll the dough around the encase the chocolate, with the seams of the dough now facing down. Prove the pain au chocolat at 26-29°C (this is really important as proving at any higher temperature will mean the butter between the layers melts) for around 2-3 hrs, until doubled in size. Heat the oven to 175C/155C fan/gas 4, brush the pain au chocolat with the remaining egg and bake for 15-18 mins until golden brown and cooked through.Best eaten on the day butwill keep in an airtight container for two days.\n",

      "Instructions: Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Line the base of a deep 23cm springform cake tin with baking parchment.Whiskthe oil, milk, vanilla and egg together in a jug. Combine the flour, bicarb, cocoa and sugar in a bowl using an electric whisk. Add the wet ingredients to the dry, and whisk until smooth and just combined. Pour into the tin and bake for 18-20 mins until risen, firm and a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean. Cool in the tin for 10 mins, then turn out onto a wire rack, top-side down – this will help flatten it if it’s slightly domed. Meanwhile, make the custard. Put all the chocolate in a large heatproof bowl. Warm the 130ml milk and 350ml of the cream in a medium pan over a low heat until steaming. Combine the cornflour and the 1 tbsp milk in a medium bowl until smooth, then whisk in the eggs and sugar. Slowly pour in the warm cream mixture, whisking all the time. Wipe out the pan and return the custard to it. Warm gently, stirring continuously until the custard has thickened and reached 76C. Pour this over the chocolate and leave for a few minutes to melt, then stir until smooth. Stir in the liqueur, if using. Pour the custard into a bowl and cover with a disc of parchment. Cool. Once completely cool, whisk the rest of the cream to soft peaks and fold this into the custard. Clean the cake tin and line with parchment. If the sponge is domed, trim the top with aserrated knife. Put the sponge in the tin, bottom-side up. Spoon over the custard, smooth the surface and chill for 6 hrs to set. For the ganache, put the chocolate in a heatproof bowl. Warm the cream and glucose in a small pan over a low heat until the glucose has melted and the cream is steaming. Pour this over the chocolate. Leave for a few minutes, then stir until smooth. Cool at room temp until thick but still liquid. Pour this over the custard. Level the surface and chill for 2 hrs to set. Decorate with the stars and truffles, sprayed with gold spray.\n",
