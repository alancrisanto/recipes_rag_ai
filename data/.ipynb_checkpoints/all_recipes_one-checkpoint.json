Once all the butter has been worked in, carry on mixing for a minute or two until smooth. Form into a ball and cover the bowl with a tea towel. Leave for about an hour until doubled in size.",
      "Tip the dough out onto a floured surface and knead to knock out the air, then divide into 24 equal pieces, roughly weighing 45g each, and roll each into a ball. Take the cheese out of the box, set aside and put the empty box in the middle of a largebaking traylined with baking parchment. Arrange a ring of 8-10 dough balls around the box, then another ring of balls around that one, fitting them into the gaps. Leave to prove in a warm place for 30 mins or chill for a few hours.",
      "Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Brush the dough balls with the reserved beaten egg, sprinkle with salt and use a pair ofscissorsto make a snip in the top of each one to give them a spiked effect. Unwrap the cheese and return to the wooden box. Sprinkle over the breadcrumbs and thyme leaves, and bake for 25-30 mins until the dough balls are golden brown. Leave to cool for 5 mins, then scatter over the bay leaves, if using, and serve with cranberry sauce or chilli jam."

Pour this into the tin, smooth the surface and bake for 40-45 mins until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Combine the evaporated and condensed milks with 50ml of the double cream.",
      "Leave the cake to cool in the tin for 10-15 mins, then carefully invert onto a serving plate or cake stand and remove the parchment. (Be sure to use a plate or stand with a slight lip to catch the excess milk.) Leave to cool for another 10 mins.",
      "Poke holes over the cake with a skewer and, while it’s still warm, slowly pour roughly a quarter of the milk mixture over the top. Leave the cake to absorb this before adding more, then repeat until all of the milk mixture is used up – if the cake becomes saturated before you’ve used all the milk, pour what’s left into a jug and serve alongside the cake later for pouring over. This process could take a couple of hours, but as soon as the cake is cool, you should transfer it to the fridge. Once all of the milk has been absorbed, chill for another 2 hrs, or overnight, to chill and improve the texture.",
      "Whip the remaining cream and the 2 tbsp condensed milk to soft peaks. Spoon over the chilled cake, then dust with a pinch of cinnamon.Will keep chilled for two days."

      "If you have time, prepare the dough the day before you want to bake – this will help develop the flavour. Warm the milk in a pan over a medium heat until just steaming (don’t let it boil), about 5 mins. Remove from the heat and add the treacle and butter, swirling the pan for 1-2 mins until the butter has melted and the milk has cooled slightly (it should be just warm).",
      "Tip the flour and spices into a large bowl, or the bowl of astand mixer. Add the yeast and 2 tbsp sugar to one side of the bowl, and ½ tsp salt to the other. Whisk together, then pour in the warm milk mixture. Mix using a wooden spoon or dough hook attachment until you have a soft dough (it should be a little sticky). Tip onto a lightly floured surface and knead by hand for 8-10 mins, or using the mixer for about 5 mins. Add another 1 tbsp flour if the dough is very sticky. It should feel stretchy and soft – you should be able to pull it without it breaking straightaway, which indicates the gluten has been developed. Lightly oil a bowl, tip in the dough, cover and leave to prove at room temperature for 2-3 hrs, or until doubled in size. Chill overnight if you can. (If the dough is being chilled, take it out of the fridge 30 mins before using.",
      "For the spiced butter, combine the butter, sugar, vanilla, spices and a pinch of salt until smooth, then stir in the stem ginger. Tip the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, shape into a rough rectangle, thenroll outto about 50 x 40cm. Spread the spiced butter over in an even layer all the way to the edges.",
      "Working from one of the longer sides, roll the dough up as tightly as you can into a log. Cut in half, then cut each half into three pieces, then halve each piece so you have 12 pieces in total. Line a large, round baking dish or cake tin (about 33cm) with baking parchment. Arrange the buns in the dish or tin cut-side up, leaving some space between each to expand. Cover loosely and leave for 30 mins-2 hrs (depending on how warm your kitchen is) until the buns have puffed up and are touching. Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6.",
      "Bake the buns for 25 mins until golden. If they still look a little doughy at the centre but the edges are dark, cover with foil and continue to bake until they are cooked through. Leave to cool slightly in the tin until just warm. Once cool, the buns will keep frozen for three months. Defrost overnight and warm in low oven before icing. Meanwhile, make the icing.",
      "Melt the butter in a saucepan over a medium heat, swirling the pan until the butter turns nut brown – watch closely to ensure it doesn’t burn. You should see the milk solids start to turn golden after 5-8 mins, and it will have a nutty aroma. Pour into a heatproof bowl and chill for 30 mins until softly set, or freeze for 15 mins, stirring every 5 mins. It should be a spreadable consistency.",
      "Beat the chilled brown butter, soft cheese, icing sugar and spices together until smooth. Spread the icing over the buns while they are still slightly warm, so the icing drips into the swirls without melting completely. Leave to set for 30 mins before serving.Will keep for up to three days in an airtight container."

      "Pour in the milk and use the knife to stir it in until the mixture clumps together. If it looks dry, add a little more milk. Tip the dough onto a lightly floured surface and gently knead until any dry floury patches are incorporated – try not to overmix, as you’ll end up with tough scones. Roll or pat the dough until it’s roughly 1cm thick. Use a 5cm cookie cutter to stamp out the scones – we made 18. Arrange the scones on top of the beef stew in a single layer, leaving space for them to expand during cooking. Place any others on a baking tray lined with baking parchment. Sprinkle each with a little more cheese, cover the casserole with a lid and bake for 15 mins along with the extra scones.",
      "Remove the tray of scones from the oven and leave to cool. Uncover the casserole and return it to the oven for another 15 mins, or until the scones on top are puffed and golden. Serve with cooked green veg, if you like."

      "Tip the batter into the prepared tin, gently level the surface with aspatulaor palette knife, and bake for 20-30 mins, or until just set – the top should have a shiny crust, but the centre should have a slight wobble. Leave to cool completely in the tin, about 1 hr. Remove to a board and cut into 16 pieces.Will keep in an airtight container for up to five days."

      "Lightly oil a deep 20cm loose-bottomed cake tin and line the side with baking parchment. Tip the biscuits into afood processorand blitz to a powder, then add the melted butter and blitz again to combine. Alternatively, bash the biscuits in a large bowl using the end of a rolling pin, then mix in the butter. Tip the buttery crumbs into the prepared tin and firmly press down with a spoon into an even base. Chill in the freezer for 10 mins while you make the filling.",
      "Combine the soft cheese, 200ml of the cream, 200g of the sugar and the vanilla extract in a bowl using an electricwhisk. Beat for 2-3 mins until the mixture has a thick, spreadable consistency. Divide between two bowls and stir a drop of pink food colouring into one until it is an even shade of pink. Put the pink cheesecake mixture in the fridge, then scrape the plain mixture into the tin, spreading it gently to the edge and levelling the surface. Freeze for at least 1 hr, or up to a day.",
      "Stir the pink cheesecake mixture, then pour it over the set plain layer and return to the freezer for another 2 hrs, or until you’re ready to serve. Will keep frozen for up to a month.",
      "Remove the cheesecake from the freezer 30 mins before serving. After 10 mins, you should be able to slide a fish slice between the biscuit base and the tin, and carefully lift the cheesecake onto a plate or cake stand, removing the parchment. Whisk the remaining 200ml cream and remaining 50g icing sugar to soft peaks, then transfer to apiping bagfitted with a large star nozzle and pipe 12 rosettes around the edge of the cheesecake. Top each with a cherry and a pinch of sprinkles.You can serve the cheesecake completely defrosted as well as slightly frozen – it will hold its shape well. Will keep chilled for two days."

While still slightly warm, use the baking parchment to roll the sponge from the short end, creating a log.

Keep stirring until the mixture is thick enough to see a clear line drawn through it with the spoon and it starts to leave the sides of the pan. It will be very thick and make big bubbles that burst as it cooks, so be careful. Once the cornflour mixture is fully incorporated, continue cooking for about 20 minutes or until it reaches the desired consistency. Test the mix by dropping a small amount into very cold water; it should form a ball that can be pressed gently when cold and that will feel a little springy.",

Pack the squash and shallot mixture into the cavities of the squash halves, and press down with your hands to ensure it’s well packed.

Lay the pastry carefully over the beetroot-covered squash, pressing down the edges lightly to seal, making sure you work from one end to the next so you don’t seal in too much air. Trim any excess pastry and, using a fork, press down all around the edges to seal. Cut any trimmings into leaf or star shapes to decorate the top, if you like. Brush beaten egg all over the wellington, top with the pastry decorations, if using, and brush with egg again. Sprinkle over the nigella seeds and a pinch of sea salt flakes",

Slit the vanilla pod down its length with a small sharp knife and scoop out as many of the tiny black seeds as you can into the cream mixture. Cut the pod into three and drop it into the pan.",
      "Heat the cream and milk over a low heat, stirring occasionally, until it almost boils – you’ll see a few bubbles at the edge. Take off the heat and set aside for 30 minutes so the vanilla can infuse.",
      "Put the egg yolks into a bowl with the rest of the sugar and beat with an electric hand beater for about 2 minutes until the mixture has thickened, is paler in colour and falls in thick ribbons when you lift the beaters. Using a measuring jug, scoop out about 125ml/4fl oz of the cream mixture and beat into the egg yolks to slacken them. Reheat the cream until it just comes to the boil, take off the heat and stir in the egg yolk mixture.",
      "Return the pan to a low heat and cook, stirring all the time with a wooden spoon, for 8-10 minutes, until the custard is thick enough to coat the back of the spoon. Watch that it doesn’t boil – as soon as you see any bubbles about to burst to the surface, it should be thick enough, so take the pan off the heat so the mixture doesn’t curdle.",
      "Pour the custard into a heatproof bowl, then sit it in a bigger bowl one third full of iced water to cool (this takes about 20 minutes). Stir occasionally to stop a skin forming. Put the bowl of custard in the fridge for 3-4 hours, preferably overnight, so it gets really cold.",
      "Get the ice cream machine running, scoop out the vanilla pod pieces, then slowly pour in the cold custard. Leave it to churn for 10-30 minutes (depending on your machine). When it stops, it is probably too soft to eat, so spoon into a plastic container, cover with cling film, then a lid, and freeze for a minimum of 3 hours. (It will keep in the freezer for 3 months but don’t take it out, then refreeze.) Remove from the freezer 15 minutes before serving.",
      "To make it by hand: in step 1, heat the milk, vanilla, and half the sugar without the cream (the custard will be slightly thicker). At the start of step 6, whip the cream so it’s light and floppy, not too stiff, and fold it into the cold custard. Freeze for 3-4 hours, stirring once an hour until almost frozen, then freeze as above."

Cook the mole for 1 hr, mixing in vegetable stock from time to time to avoid it burning or going dry. You want it to be the consistency of a loose paste. The mole is ready when a layer of oil appears on the surface. Serve over meat with rice or use to topenchiladas."

If using a gas barbecue, see tip.) Cook the lamb for 2-3 hrs (it will be cooked at this point), then transfer to a flameproof roasting tin. Peel the garlic and add to the tin with the red pepper, onions, chillies, vinegar and stock. Cook for another 1-2 hrs until the lamb is 92C when atemperatureprobe is inserted, or the shoulder blade slides out easily.",
      "While the lamb is cooking, prepare the salsa. Put the chillies, peppers, onions and tomatoes directly into the embers, or on the gas barbecue flame. Remove each ingredient once blistered. The chillies will only need 30 seconds or so, but the onions will need at least 15 mins. Roast the garlic bulb to the side of the embers or flame until soft. Leave everything to cool, then squeeze the onions and garlic out of their skins. (Keep the charred skin on everything else.) Chop all the veg, discarding the stems and seeds, then put in a bowl. Drizzle over the olive oil and pour in the vinegar to taste. Add a good pinch of salt and black pepper, then stir in the mint.",
      "For the sumac shallots, put the shallots in a bowl, then sprinkle over the sumac, sugar and a pinch of salt. Drizzle in the olive oil and the red wine vinegar, and mix well.",
      "Once the lamb is cooked, remove from the tin, pull out the shoulder blade and put the meat on a platter. Tip the veg and juices from the tin into afood processor, or use ahand blenderto blitz everything together and create a chilli sauce. Serve with the flatbreads and the chopped parsley sprinkled over."

      "Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. For the meringue, tip all the nuts onto abaking trayand roast for 10-12 mins, shaking the tray halfway through cooking, until toasted. Leave to cool completely. Reduce the oven to 150C/130C fan/gas 2.",
      "Line three baking sheets with baking parchment. Use the base of a 20cm cake tin as a template to draw a circle on each sheet of parchment, then flip these over on their trays to prevent the pen from marking the meringue. Tip the cooled nuts into afood processorand whizz to a powder. Blitz in the icing sugar and cornflour, and set aside.",
      "Tip the egg whites into a large, clean bowl (any oil in the bowl will prevent the egg whites from whipping up fully). Add a pinch of salt and whisk with an electric whisk or in a stand mixer for 3-5 mins until fluffy and doubled in volume. Add the caster sugar, a spoonful at a time, whisking continuously until all the sugar has been incorporated and the meringue is glossy and stiff. Scatter the ground nut mixture over the surface, then use a large metal spoon to gently fold this into the meringue. Transfer the meringue to apiping bagfitted with a large round nozzle.",
      "Starting in the centre of one of the circle templates, pipe a tight spiral of meringue to the edge so the circle is filled. Repeat with the remaining two templates, then use up any leftover meringue to fill any gaps. Smooth the surfaces of the meringue discs with a palette knife so they're flat on top. Bake the meringues for 1 hr, swapping the trays around after 30 mins so they cook evenly. After 1 hr, leave to cool in the oven with the door closed for at least 2 hrs, or overnight.",
      "To make the coffee diplomat, warm the milk, the 300ml cream and coffee in a pan over a low heat until just steaming (don't let it boil). Meanwhile, brieflywhiskthe vanilla, cornflour, caster sugar and egg yolks together in a large bowl until just combined. Slowly pour the hot milk mixture over the egg yolk mixture, whisking continuously. Strain the mixture through a sieve back into the saucepan, then set over a low-medium heat and cook, stirring continuously with a rubber spatula to prevent the mixture from burning, for 4-5 mins. Don’t rush this as the eggs can easily scramble. After this time, the custard should be thick and smooth. Remove the pan from the heat, scrape the custard into a clean bowl, cover the surface and chill for 1-2 hrs until completely cold.",
      "For the praline, toast the hazelnuts in the oven as you did the nuts in step 1. Lightly oil a baking tray. Weigh the sugar out into a pan and set over a medium heat. Cook, without stirring, until the sugar has dissolved and turned from amber to deep caramel – you can swirl the pan occasionally, but don't stir. Tip in the toasted hazelnuts and swirl to coat in caramel, then tip onto the oiled baking tray. Sprinkle over a pinch of salt and leave to set until hard, about 20 mins. Once set, break the praline into shards and blitz in a food processor to a coarse rubble.",
      "To make the ganache, put the chocolate and a pinch of salt in a heatproof bowl. Warm the cream in a saucepan over a low heat until just steaming, then pour this over the chocolate. Leave to stand for 3-4 mins until the chocolate has melted, then stir into a thick, glossy ganache. Leave to cool at room temperature until needed.",
      "When the coffee diplomat has cooled and set, beat it with aspatulato loosen slightly, then fold in the 100ml lightly whipped cream, a spoonful at a time, until fully incorporated. Spoon into a piping bag fitted with a round nozzle.",
      "Put one meringue disc on a plate, sticking it down with a small blob of the coffee diplomat. Spread half the ganache over the meringue, then pipe over a third of the diplomat. Repeat once, then top with the final meringue and pipe the rest of the diplomat on top. Scatter over the praline rubble, then decorate with gold leaf or lustre, if you like.Best eaten straightaway, but will keep chilled for up to three days."

Remove from the oven and leave to cool for 25 mins on the tray. The granola should be crunchy and all the moisture evaporated once cooled.This will make more than you need but it will store in an airtight jar for up to a month.",

Whisk until the cream just holds soft peaks, then stir through most of the raspberries, mashing some lightly to create ripples. Using a serrated knife to cut down the middle of the buns, from the top and stopping around 2cm from the base. Spoon the cream into apiping bag, if you have one, and fill the buns with it, or use the spoon. (If using a piping bag, snip a hole in the end that’s large enough for the raspberries to come through.) While doing this, open the buns slightly, being careful not to break the base. Use the flat side of a cutlery knife or an offset spatula to scrape away any excess cream and achieve a smooth finish. Dip the maritozzi in the chopped hazelnuts and tear over the remaining raspberries. Dust with icing sugar to serve, if you like.Best served on the day of making but will keep in the fridge for to to two days."

Push the garlic cloves and rosemary leaves deeply into the dough, evenly spaced apart. Drizzle with 1 tbsp olive oil and dimple a few more times to create oil puddles on the surface. Scatter over the 1 tsp sea salt flakes, give the dough a final poke and bake for 25-30 mins until puffed up and deep golden.

      "To make the dough, tip the flour into the bowl of astand mixeralong with the cinnamon, if using, ½ tsp salt and the sugar and yeast. Mix using the dough hook attachment until fully combined. Mix in the milk, then, on a medium speed, add the eggs one at a time. Mix for 5-8 mins until you have a smooth dough that comes away from the sides of the bowl. Leave the dough in the bowl for 10 mins.",
      "Gradually add the butter, one or two cubes at a time, beating until fully mixed into the dough, scraping down the bowl with a plasticspatula,if needed. Tip the dough into a buttered bowl or round plastic container, and cover and chill overnight until nearly doubled in size. If you want to bake on the same day, leave at room temperature for about 2 hrs until nearly doubled in size, then chill for at least 1 hr – the dough needs to be well chilled for the next step.",
      "Meanwhile, make the filling. Melt the chocolate in a small bowl over a pan of warm water, ensuring the bowl doesn’t touch the water, or in 10-second bursts in themicrowave, then leave to cool. In a separate bowl, mix the butter and sugar together, then add the ground almonds. Sift in the cocoa powder and mix in the melted chocolate along with a pinch of sea salt to create a spreadable paste.",
      "Tip the dough onto a lightly floured surface and roll out to a neatish rectangle that’s about 30 x 40cm. With the long edge facing you, spread the filling evenly over the dough using aspatulaor palette knife, leaving a thin border around the edge, then scatter over the almonds. Starting with the long edge closest to you, neatly roll the dough away from you into a tight log, just like you would when making cinnamon rolls. If you have space in the fridge, transfer the roll, seam-side down, to a tray and chill for 1 hr (this step isn’t essential, but it helps give neat layers to the finished loaf ).",
      "Butter a 900g loaf tin and line with a strip of baking parchment across the middle of the tin, so it hangs over each end. Use a sharp or serrated knife, cut the log in half lengthways to create two long pieces. Lay the two pieces out so they're parallel, then plait together until you have about 8 twists. Transfer to the loaf tin, tucking the ends under slightly, and fattening up the plait to fit. Cover with a tea towel and leave to rise at room temperature for 2-3 hrs, or until risen by about half.",
      "Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and bake for 45 mins until dark golden – if you have a digital cooking thermometer, it should read 90C when inserted into the middle.",
      "Make the syrup by boiling the sugar with 4 tbsp water in a small pan until the sugar has dissolved. When the babka comes out of the oven, brush liberally with the syrup, letting it soak in a little before you add more, until it’s all used up. Leave the babka to cool to room temperature.Best eaten on the day its baked, but will keep in an airtight container for two days."

      "To make the sponge, sift all the dry ingredients (flour, cocoa powder, caster sugar, baking powder, cornflour, bicarbonate of soda and ½ tsp salt) together in a mixing bowl. In a small jug, combine the oat milk and vinegar to create a vegan buttermilk. Set aside.",
      "In a separate mixing bowl, whisk the aquafaba until the liquid has transformed to soft peaks – be patient as this can take up to 5 mins. It’s best to use an electric handheld whisk or freestanding mixer.",
      "Add the vegetable oil and vanilla extract to the jug of oat milk and vinegar. Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl of dry ingredients and use large metal spoon to combine until you have a thick batter. Stir a third of the whipped aquafaba into the batter. Once the batter has loosened slightly, tip the chocolate batter into the bowl with the remaining aquafaba and fold through until combined, being careful not to knock too much air from the mixture. Pour this into the prepared baking tin, level out with a spatula, and bake for 20-22 mins.",
      "Leave the sponge in the tin to cool for 5 mins before turning it out onto a large piece of parchment dusted with 1 tbsp icing sugar. Peel off the top parchment used to line the tin and leave for a further 2-3 mins to cool slightly. While still slightly warm, use the baking parchment to roll the sponge from the short end, creating a log. Carefully unroll and allow to cool completely – rolling the sponge while slightly warm helps prevent large cracks. But don’t worry if there are small cracks as they’ll be hidden by the ganache.",
      "For the filling, whisk the icing sugar, vanilla extract and plant-based double cream in a bowl until soft peaks have formed. The sponge should now be cool. Spread an even layer of the cream over the flat sponge. Then, as before, roll the filled sponge into a log and use the baking parchment to hold in a log shape. Transfer to a plate or board and into the fridge for 30 mins-1 hr.",
      "When you are ready to decorate, carefully unwrap the yule log from the parchment. Snip the end of the piping bag and pipe thick horizontal lines to cover the sponge with chocolate ganache. Use a spoon to create a soft pillowy finish to the ganache, or a fork to create a bark-like effect. Finish with any accompanying decorations – berries, edible holly décor or a spritz of gold spray. Transfer to the fridge for at least 1 hr or until you’re ready to serve.",
      "Serve with more pouring cream and berries, if you like."

Remove from the oven and cool completely.Will keep in an airtight container for up to two days.",

Spoon over the chantilly, then dot over the reserved custard, swirl over the caramel, and spoon over the reserved apple and crumble. Scatter over some orange zest.Will keep chilled in an airtight container for three days."

When the pork is ready, lift it onto a board and rest for 10 mins. For a lighter gravy, pour the fat out of the roasting tray, leaving behind any caramelised bits.

Add the coconut oil, black beans, banana, cocoa powder, maple syrup, vanilla, bicarbonate of soda, baking powder, salt, and the drained dates. Pour in 1 tbsp of the date liquid. Blitz until smooth then stir in the walnuts and chocolate chips. Spoon into the tin and smooth out. Bake for 30-35 mins until set and leave to cool completely in the tin. Once cooled, leave overnight in the fridge to set (this makes them extra fudgy and easier to slice).

      "First, make the craquelin. Combine the butter, sugar, flour and hazelnuts in a bowl, then spread out over a sheet of baking parchment. Cover with another sheet of parchment and roll the mixture out until it's 2mm thick. Put in the freezer to chill while you prepare the choux.",
      "While the craquelin chills, sift the flour onto a sheet of baking parchment and fold in half (you will use the parchment as a funnel for adding the flour). Pour the milk, sugar, ½ tsp salt and the butter into a pan with 150ml water. Bring to the boil, then remove from the heat and quickly tip in the flour using the parchment as a funnel. Quickly and vigorously stir in the flour using a whisk. Return the pan to a low heat and, using a wooden spoon, stir for 1 min, beating well. The dough should start to come away from the bottom of the pan easily. Transfer the mixture to a stand mixer and beat for 30 seconds to cool slightly (or do this with an electric whisk in a bowl). Slowly pour in the egg, beating continuously using the mixer or whisk while checking the consistency of the dough – it should be smooth and silky, and you may not need all the egg. When ready, the dough should be able to slowly drop off a wooden spoon. (You can also mix in the egg by hand using a wooden spoon.)",
      "Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Spoon the choux into a piping bag fitted with a large round nozzle. Draw 14-16 circles over two sheets of baking parchment using an 8cm round biscuit cutter as a guide, then flip over and use to line two large baking trays (you should get at least 14 mini Paris-Brest, but may get up to 16, depending on your mixture). Pipe rings of choux inside the circle templates, leaving the middles clear. Stamp out 14-16 circles of craquelin using the same 8cm cutter, then use a 5cm cutter to stamp out the middles to make rings. Put these on top of the piped choux, then bake for 30-35 mins until risen, golden and completely dry – they should sound hollow when gently tapped, and feel light. Remove from the oven and leave to cool completely on the baking trays.",
      "For the mousseline, pour the milk into a pan and warm over a low heat, swirling the pan to ensure it doesn’t catch, until it just starts to steam. Combine the egg yolks, sugar and cornflour in a heatproof bowl using a whisk. Slowly whisk in the hot milk, then pour back into the pan and return to a medium heat. Continue to whisk until the mixture thickens, then whisk in the hazelnut butter and a large pinch of salt. Remove from the heat and spread the mixture out over a plate to cool completely. Once cooled, tip the butter into a bowl and beat using an electric whisk until smooth and creamy. Add half the cooled hazelnut mixture and beat well, then beat in the rest until smooth and just holding its shape.",
      "To assemble the individual Paris-Brests, cut the choux pastry rings in half through the equator using a serrated knife. Spoon the hazelnut mousseline into a piping bag fitted with a small round or fluted nozzle, and pipe into the bottom half of the choux. Sandwich with the top half and generously dust with icing sugar."

Slowly bring the flour to the centre, little by little (using a fork or your fingers) to make a sticky dough, then knead for at least 7-10 mins or until soft, smooth and pliable. If it is still sticky, don't add more flour. Once kneaded, add a little oil or ghee to your hands and cover the dough’s surface with it. Put the dough back in the bowl, cover with a tea towel and leave to rest for at least 20-30 mins.",
      "Divide the dough into six equal balls, set them aside on a clean worktop and cover with a tea towel. Divide the filling into six equal portions and set aside.",
      "Dust your worktop with flour, then take a dough ball and press it with your fingers to make a circle about 10cm wide. Spoon 30-40g filling into the middle and pinch the dough together to form a dumpling-like ball. Make sure all the filling is enclosed inside as you don’t want it escaping when youroll the naan out.",
      "To roll out the naans, use a rolling pin and gently roll out the filled naan from the centre to the edges carefully – try not to apply much pressure. Use your hands to keep moving the dough around so it does not stick to the surface. Roll out until about 20cm wide. Sprinkle some of the chopped pistachios on top.",
      "There are two cooking methods you can use – over a gas hob or in the oven. To cook on a gas hob and replicate the tandoor effect, heat a stainless-steel tawa pan or frying pan (do not use non-stick as you want the bread to stick to it when you flip the pan), until hot. Turn the naan over carefully, wet the back of it with plain water, then carefully place on the heated tawa/frying pan. Place the pan on the hob, cook for about 1 min or until small bubbles appear on the surface of the naan, then brush the warm rosewater-milk on top. Lift the pan and flip it (with the bread stuck to the pan), holding it directly over the flame – it won't fall off because the water ensures it sticks on (this is what happens in a tandoor). Cook over the open flame evenly until it starts to go dark and charred in places. Gently remove the naan with a metalspatula,then brush with melted ghee and sprinkle over the remaining pistachios, flaked almonds and crystallised rose petals now, if using. Serve immediately or wrap in foil to keep soft. Repeat with the rest of the dough balls.",
      "To cook in the oven, heat the oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 8 or the hottest it can get and turn the grill on too. Using an oven-proof tray, line with baking parchment, place the naan on top and brush with the warm milk and rosewater mixture. Put in the oven on the middle shelf for about 6-8 mins. Keep an eye on it and make sure you don't let it burn. Once cooked, brush with ghee and sprinkle over the remaining pistachios and flaked almonds, and the crystallised rose petals, if using. Serve immediately or keep wrapped in foil while you continue cooking the rest."

Scrape the different batters into the tins, trying to spread and smooth as much as possible – but try not to waste a drop of the batter – a rubber spatula will help you. Bake on the same oven shelf for 15-20 mins until a skewer poked into the middle comes out clean. Don't worry if the sponges are thin, there are many layers.",

      "To make the icing, very briefly beat the vanilla and soft cheese or mascarpone with an electric whisk until smooth. Sift in the icing sugar and gently fold in with a spatula. Be careful – the more you work it, the runnier it will get, increasing the chance of splitting.",
      "Smear a little icing on your cake stand or plate – just a splodge to stick the first sponge. Start with the red, then spread with some icing right to the very edge.

      "Whisk on medium speed until the mixture becomes meringue-like and has reached stiff peaks, about 3 mins. (You could use an electric whisk, but it will take considerably longer, around 35 mins.) Add the butter 1 tbsp at a time, whisking to combine before the next addition. It may look curdled and soupy but be patient and keep whisking until you have a smooth, fluffy buttercream. Whisk in the vanilla. If using this buttercream to ice a cake, change to the paddle attachment and set it on a low speed for a few minutes – this helps remove air bubbles from the icing and makes for a smoother finish to your cake.

      "For the papdi, put both the flours, semolina, carom seeds, cumin seeds and 1 tsp salt in amixing bowl. Gently mix the dry ingredients with your fingers, then mix in the ghee until you have a breadcrumb-like texture. Gradually mix in up to 10 tbsp lukewarm water, 2 tbsp at a time, until you form a dough and there are no bits left on the sides of the bowl. Turn out onto a clean work surface and knead a few times to form a soft dough. Put the dough back in the bowl and cover with a damp tea towel. Rest for 1 hr.",
      "Divide the dough into six equal balls. Flatten with the palm of your hand, then put on a lightly floured work surface. Roll out into a circle approximately 2mm in thickness. Using a 5cm cookie cutter, cut out as many circles as possible. Put each on a floured work surface to stop it from sticking. Repeat with the other five balls of dough. Once all the papdis have been cut out, take a fork and gently prick them about three times. This stops the papdi from puffing up.",
      "Half-fill a wok or karai with veg oil and heat until one papdi dropped in bubbles and rises to the top. Gently lower a few more into the oil, taking care not to add too many at once. Try to fry them as horizontally as possible to get flat papdis. Cook for a few minutes until golden. They can also be baked: put on baking sheet lined with baking parchment and cook in the oven at 180C/160C fan/gas 4 for 25 mins, turning halfway through, until golden. Once the papdis have been cooked, leave to cool to room temperature.",

Take off the heat and leave to cool for a few minutes, then tip into ablenderwith the coriander, mint, garlic, lemon juice, 1½ tsp salt, the sugar, chillies and 3 tbsp water. Blitz to a thick paste.

Drizzle over the tamarind sauce and repeat with the raita. With a teaspoon, add half spoonfuls of the green chutney around the topping. Sprinkle over the pomegranate seeds, onions and coriander over. Generously sprinkle the gram noodles over the dish and serve. Serve straightaway."

Stir in the gram flour – it needs to be roasted to get rid of the raw smell. Cook on a low heat for 5 mins, stirring constantly to ensure it doesn’t burn. Stir in the lentil mixture and mix well to ensure there are no lumps. Tip in the ginger, chopped green chilli, turmeric, asafoetida, 1½ tsp salt, the sugar, 1 tsp of the spice powder you prepared earlier and the garam masala. Mix well and cook for 2-3 mins until the water has evaporated. The lentil filling should be dry and thick. Take off heat and allow to cool.",

Take a ball of dough and flatten with both palms into a flat circle, then by pressing your thumb against the ends, to make it thinner and larger in size. Put in the cup of your palm, so the dough takes that shape and fill with 1 tbsp of cooled filling.",
      "Bring the sides of the dough to the centre and pinch the ends to seal (try not to pinch too much of the dough together or that end will be too doughy). Repeat the process for 10 portions.",

It should roll easily into a ball without sticking. If it does stick, continue heating the mixture over a gentle heat for a few more minutes. While the dough is still warm but not too hot to handle, spread out on the tray and allow to cook for around 15 mins.",
      "Rub a little ghee into your hand, then knead the dough gently (it will feel like soft fudge) for 1 min and then carefully begin to flatten it with your fingers to form a small circle. Put a few drops of ghee over the flattened dough. With a rolling pin, gently roll out the dough into a rough square to a thickness of about 1 cm.",

      "Up to 48 hrs and at least 12 hrs before cooking, loosen the skin of the turkey, over the breast, by pushing your hand beneath it. Season the turkey all over, including under the skin, with 1-2 tbsp flaky sea salt. (The further ahead you do this, the more succulent it will be.) Chop the turkey neck. Put the turkey in a largeroasting tinor on an oven tray, breast-side up, and chill, uncovered, until ready to cook.",
      "On the day of roasting, remove the turkey from the fridge at least 1 hr before cooking. Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Remove the turkey from the tin and tip the onions, carrots, turkey neck and giblets into the tin. If you have one, sit a roasting rack, trivet or ovenproof cooling rack in or over the tray and sit the turkey on top. Put the lemon halves in the cavity of the turkey with the garlic and rosemary. Spoon the flavoured butter under the turkey skin, spread it all over the breast meat and as far down to the legs as possible. For a neat finish, tie the wings and legs together using butcher’s string. Drizzle half the oil over the turkey and rub it all over.",
      "Put the turkey in the oven, roast for 1 hr, then remove, drizzle with the remaining oil, then return to the oven, turning the tin around, for another 1 hr. When the turkey has had 1 hr 45 mins in total, check it using atemperature probe thermometer– the timings differ depending on how long you’ve salted your turkey for and what breed of turkey you’re roasting. (If you don’t have a probe, see our tips, below.) Perfection is when the thickest part of the breast is about 65C and the thickest part of the thigh is 75C. If the temperature is lower, return the turkey to the oven for 15-min intervals and check again. Leave the turkey to cool for 10 mins on the rack, then use tongs to remove the lemon and garlic from the cavity and transfer to a board that has a moat or a platter to collect the resting juices. Leave to rest for at least another 20 mins (it will remain hot for at least 40 mins).",
      "Meanwhile, make the gravy. If the roasting tin you cooked the turkey in is flameproof, put it straight on a medium heat, if not tip the contents into a large, shallow pan and put on the heat with the cooked lemon halves, garlic and rosemary sprigs. Scatter over the flour, stir to make a paste, then stir in the wine and soy sauce and sizzle for about 5 mins until it’s a thick paste. Stir in the stock and all the turkey resting juices and simmer for 5 mins, stirring all the time. Strain the gravy into a jug or another pan to reheat when needed. Carve the turkey and serve with your choice of sides, or carve at the table."

Pour the sushi-su over the rice and fold it carefully in with a wooden spoon as it cools down, being careful not to damage the grains. You can use a fan or a hairdryer on the coolest setting to speed up the cooling process, directing it at the rice. The sushi-su gives the rice more flavour and that familiar sticky glazed look.",
      "If you don’t want to use the rice immediately, cover it with a damp cloth so that it doesn’t dry out. Leave in a cool place for up to 2 hrs. Do not refrigerate as the fridge will make the rice dry and hard to shape.Once assembled, the sushi can be chilled for a day."

Using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll out a portion of dough into an oval 3mm thick. Heat a large frying pan over a high heat. The higher the heat, the more bubbles you’ll get in the naan. Once heated, carefully transfer the naan to the dry frying pan using a fish slice. Leave to cook on one side for 2 mins or until nicely browned, then flip and cook for 1 min. After flipping, press down firmly on the naan using a spatula – this encourages it to puff up a little. Repeat using the rest of the dough.",

Crack in the eggs one at a time, beating well for 1 min after each addition, until they have all been added. Beat in the vanilla, then fold in the flour mixture gently. Carefully spoon into the prepared tin and bake for 35-40 mins until a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean. Set aside to cool completely on a wire rack in the tin.",

      "Cut the cooled cake in half horizontally using a serrated knife, so you have two layers. Put the bottom layer on a plate or cake stand and spread over a generous spoonful of the pistachio cream. Top with a generous handful of the raspberries so the cake is covered. Top with the other sponge half, then cover the top and sides of the cake with the remaining cream. Scatter over the last of the raspberries, the remaining pistachios and the lime zest to serve.Will keep chilled in an airtight container for two days."

Crack the eggs into the butter mixture one at a time, beating well after each addition.

Pour the cream over the chocolate and leave to melt for a couple of minutes. If the ganache looks too thick or like it has split, simply add 1 tbsp whole milk and stir to make a glossy ganache, then set aside to cool a little. You want the ganache to be pourable but not too hot, as it will melt your buttercream.",

You need to work quickly here so your ganache doesn’t set before it drips. Scatter the chocolate eggs over the top. Leave to set for at least 15 mins.

      "Wet your fingers slightly (damp fingers help when handling sticky sushi rice). Leave a space about 3-4cm from the bottom of the nori sheet. Spread the rice over the rest of the nori evenly and gently with your fingertips. You want roughly a 2mm layer. Do not press it onto the sheet.",
      "Sprinkle 1 tbsp of tobiko, masago or sesame seeds over the rice; this will end up on the outside of the roll. Carefully flip the nori over on the mat so the rice is now underneath and the nori is face-up. Put the wasabi, if using, and salmon in a single line at the bottom of the nori on the area without the rice, then add half the avocado strips alongside, followed by the crabmeat in a line next to the avocado. It should all fit on to the clear area of nori just below the rice.",
      "Holding the filling in place with your index fingers, start rolling the mat from the bottom edge of the nori towards the top of the rice edge. Keep rolling, holding the roll in place, 3 or 4 times, making sure that it's tightly rolling so that there are no gaps between the fillings and the nori.",
      "Put the sushi roll on a clean, dry chopping board. Gently cut each roll into 8 pieces with a sharp, wet knife, smoothly and quickly. It’s useful to keep fingers damp when handling and chopping. We recommend cleaning the knife after every cut to avoid the rice sticking."

Scoop a little of the falafel mixture into your hands, then roll into a ball the size of a large cherry tomato. Flatten gently into a disc – the mixture will feel quite soft at this stage. Repeat to make 12 falafel in total, then put on a plate and keep chilled until you’re ready to serve.Will keep chilled for up to 24 hrs.",

Blitz to a smooth purée, adding more of the reserved chickpea liquid if the purée is too thick. Set aside in the fridge with the falafel.Will keep chilled for up to two days.",
      "Toss the pitta triangles and pumpkin seeds with the oil, cumin seeds and chilli flakes, then spread out on a baking tray and bake at 200C/180C fan/gas 6 for 8-10 mins until crisp and toasted. Or, do this in an air-fryer at 200C, tossing the mixture halfway through.",
      "Line abaking traywith parchment (or cut a piece to fit the basket of your air-fryer), brush the parchment with a little oil and arrange the falafel on the tray. Cook for 12-15 mins, turning halfway through, until crisp and golden.Once cool, the falafel will keep chilled or for up to two days – they will firm up as they cool. Reheat or eat cold.",
      "Mix all the ingredients for the dressing together. Divide the spinach between four shallow bowls or plates, and top with the grains (reheat these if you like, or serve cold), then the carrots, cucumbers, pitta chips and falafel. Generously spoon the hummus into the bowls, then drizzle over the dressing and sprinkle over the roasted pumpkin seeds and a few whole parsley to serve."
