## Sardine kushiyaki with oroshi daikon ponzu sauce
**Link:** https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/sardine-kushiyaki-with-oroshi-daikon-ponzu-sauce

**Description:** Grill sardines to get a crispy skin, then dress in ponzu sauce, which has saltiness and the fresh acidity of citrus to counter the natural oils of the fish

**Prep Time:** 10 mins

**Cook Time:** 15 mins

**Difficulty:** Easy

**Serves:** Serves 4

**Diet Type:** None

### Nutrition Information
- **kcal:** 384

- **saturates:** 4g
- **carbs:** 14g
- **sugars:** 10g
- **fibre:** 0g
- **protein:** 48g
- **salt:** 4.3g

### Ingredients
- 10 wholesardines(about 1kg), gutted
- 100mlsoy sauce
- 35mlyuzu juice(or use lemon juice)
- 25mlrice vinegar
- 35mlmirin
- 35mldashi stock(or use water)
- 200gdaikon
- For the oroshi daikon ponzu sauce
- 100mlsoy sauce
- 35mlyuzu juice(or use lemon juice)
- 25mlrice vinegar
- 35mlmirin
- 35mldashi stock(or use water)
- 200gdaikon
- 10flat skewers(see tip, below)
- You will also need
- 10flat skewers(see tip, below)

### Method
- Tip all of the ingredients for the ponzu sauce, except the daikon, into asterilised jarand mix together. (The dashi stock is optional, but it softens the sauce while adding umami in the background. Use water if you don’t have dashi.)Will keep chilled for up to three months.Peel the daikon, then grate it on the finest side of the grater. Squeeze out the water and set aside in a bowl.
- Rinse the sardines, then sprinkle generously with salt, especially the fins and tails, as this keeps them from burning. Skewer the sardines lengthwise, from the tail through to the head. If the sardines are already butterflied, it is better to skewer the fish in pairs using two skewers: one across the head ends and one to secure the tail ends.
- Grill the sardines over a medium hot grill, about 230C – if you hold your hand 15cm above the coals, you should be able to keep it there for 3-4 seconds. (Be careful so you don’t burn your hands.) Cook on one side for 4-5 mins until the skin nearest the heat is crispy and the flesh is firm and bouncy to the touch.
- Serve immediately, with a mound of grated daikon in a pool of ponzu (around 1 tbsp grated daikon to 3 tbsp ponzu). When you mix the daikon into the ponzu it will thicken, which helps it stick to the fish.

## Courgette, green bean & feta salad
**Link:** https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/courgette-green-bean-feta-salad

**Description:** Layer up flavours and textures with barbecued marinated courgettes and feta, along with a hazelnut crumb. It's a lovely standalone summer salad or side dish

**Prep Time:** 20 mins

**Cook Time:** 40 mins

**Difficulty:** Easy

**Serves:** Serves 4 - 6

**Diet Type:** Vegetarian

### Nutrition Information
- **kcal:** 455
- **fat:** 37g
- **saturates:** 12g
- **carbs:** 12g
- **sugars:** 6g
- **fibre:** 5g
- **protein:** 16g
- **salt:** 1.8g

### Ingredients
- 3 mediumcourgettes(about 600-700g), sliced 2cm-thick
- 300ggreen beans,trimmed
- 2 x 200g blocks offeta,each cut in half
- 4 tbspolive oil
- 4garlic cloves,chopped
- bunch ofthyme,leaves picked
- 2red chillies,finely chopped (optional)
- 3oranges,zested
- 50gfresh breadcrumbs
- 75ghazelnuts,roughly chopped
- 4 tbspextra virgin olive oil,to serve

### Method
- Spread the courgettes and green beans out on a baking sheet. Put the feta in a small flameproof tin – a small enamel roasting tin is ideal, but you could even bake it on a sheet of foil. Drizzle 3 tbsp of the olive oil over the veg, and remaining 1 tbsp over the feta. Add about two-thirds of the garlic and thyme to the veg, along with most of the chilli, if using, then scatter the rest over the feta, reserving some of the thyme. Scatter the zest of 2 oranges over the veg and the rest over the feta. Season the feta with a good grind of black pepper and season the veg well with salt and pepper. Toss the veg together and tip into a bowl. Cover both and keep chilled until ready to cook.Will keep covered and chilled for up to 24 hrs.
- Tip the breadcrumbs onto the baking sheet and mix to soak up any marinade left on the tray, then scoop into a bowl and stir in the hazelnuts.Will keep covered and chilled for up to 24 hrs.
- Using asharp knife, cut a thin slice off the top and bottom of each zested orange. Slice off the skin in strips, removing as much of the pith as you can, then – cupping the orange in your palm – slice along each side of the membrane that separates the segments. Squeeze out what remains into a bowl and repeat with the other orange. If you aren’t confident with your knife skills, simply cut the oranges into thin slices – they’ll still taste great.
- When ready to cook, fire up thebarbecue, ready for direct and indirect grilling (see our guide onhow to light a barbecue), with the charcoal lit on one half only. Or, if using a gas barbecue, just light half the burners. This allows you to have temperature control as food can be moved closer or further away from the fire as it’s cooking. Set a frying pan directly over the fire. Once hot, tip in the breadcrumb and hazelnut mixture. Stir over the heat for a few minutes until crispy and golden, then slide the pan off the barbecue. Set aside.
- Grill the veg in batches over direct heat, starting with the courgettes, followed by the beans. Grill for a couple of minutes on each side until lightly charred and just tender, transferring to a serving dish as you go. This will take around 30 mins.
- Set the tin or foil containing the feta onto the grill bars, slightly away from the fire, and shut the barbecue lid (or cover with foil). Cook for about 10 mins until the cheese has softened – it won’t melt.
- While the feta is cooking, tuck the orange segments into the grilled veg and scatter over the hazelnut crumbs. Mix well.
- Once the cheese is ready, use a fish slice to slide it off the tray and onto the veg and oranges. Dress with a generous drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and the remaining chilli and thyme, then tuck in.

- For the sumac shallots
- 300gbanana shallots,sliced
- 20gsumac
- 1 tspsugar
- 2 tbspextra virgin olive oil
- 70mlred wine vinegar

### Method
- Pierce the lamb all over using a sharpknife. Drizzle over the oil, then sprinkle over the spices, a good pinch of salt and black pepper, and the Worcestershire sauce. Massage the shoulder well until the marinade becomes a paste and chill for at least 1 hr or overnight in the fridge.
- Prepare thebarbecue– you will need a low temperature, around 125-140C with ashen coals (I put some lit coals onto unlit coals, and a fist-sized chunk or two of seasoned cherrywood to flavour the lamb. If using a gas barbecue, see tip.) Cook the lamb for 2-3 hrs (it will be cooked at this point), then transfer to a flameproof roasting tin. Peel the garlic and add to the tin with the red pepper, onions, chillies, vinegar and stock. Cook for another 1-2 hrs until the lamb is 92C when atemperatureprobe is inserted, or the shoulder blade slides out easily.
- While the lamb is cooking, prepare the salsa. Put the chillies, peppers, onions and tomatoes directly into the embers, or on the gas barbecue flame. Remove each ingredient once blistered. The chillies will only need 30 seconds or so, but the onions will need at least 15 mins. Roast the garlic bulb to the side of the embers or flame until soft. Leave everything to cool, then squeeze the onions and garlic out of their skins. (Keep the charred skin on everything else.) Chop all the veg, discarding the stems and seeds, then put in a bowl. Drizzle over the olive oil and pour in the vinegar to taste. Add a good pinch of salt and black pepper, then stir in the mint.
- For the sumac shallots, put the shallots in a bowl, then sprinkle over the sumac, sugar and a pinch of salt. Drizzle in the olive oil and the red wine vinegar, and mix well.
- Once the lamb is cooked, remove from the tin, pull out the shoulder blade and put the meat on a platter. Tip the veg and juices from the tin into afood processor, or use ahand blenderto blitz everything together and create a chilli sauce. Serve with the flatbreads and the chopped parsley sprinkled over.

- 1½ tspvanilla extract
- 6 tbspcornflour
- 100gcaster sugar
- 5egg yolks
- For the coffee diplomat
- 500mlmilk
- 300mldouble cream, plus 100ml lightly whipped cream
- 1 tbspinstant coffee granules
- 1½ tspvanilla extract
- 6 tbspcornflour
- 100gcaster sugar
- 5egg yolks
- 100gblanched, skinned hazelnuts
- vegetable oil, for the tray
- 150gcaster sugar
- gold leafor edible gold lustre, to decorate (optional)
- For the praline
- 100gblanched, skinned hazelnuts
- vegetable oil, for the tray
- 150gcaster sugar
- gold leafor edible gold lustre, to decorate (optional)

### Method
- Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. For the meringue, tip all the nuts onto abaking trayand roast for 10-12 mins, shaking the tray halfway through cooking, until toasted. Leave to cool completely. Reduce the oven to 150C/130C fan/gas 2.
- Line three baking sheets with baking parchment. Use the base of a 20cm cake tin as a template to draw a circle on each sheet of parchment, then flip these over on their trays to prevent the pen from marking the meringue. Tip the cooled nuts into afood processorand whizz to a powder. Blitz in the icing sugar and cornflour, and set aside.
- Tip the egg whites into a large, clean bowl (any oil in the bowl will prevent the egg whites from whipping up fully). Add a pinch of salt and whisk with an electric whisk or in a stand mixer for 3-5 mins until fluffy and doubled in volume. Add the caster sugar, a spoonful at a time, whisking continuously until all the sugar has been incorporated and the meringue is glossy and stiff. Scatter the ground nut mixture over the surface, then use a large metal spoon to gently fold this into the meringue. Transfer the meringue to apiping bagfitted with a large round nozzle.
- Starting in the centre of one of the circle templates, pipe a tight spiral of meringue to the edge so the circle is filled. Repeat with the remaining two templates, then use up any leftover meringue to fill any gaps. Smooth the surfaces of the meringue discs with a palette knife so they're flat on top. Bake the meringues for 1 hr, swapping the trays around after 30 mins so they cook evenly. After 1 hr, leave to cool in the oven with the door closed for at least 2 hrs, or overnight.
- To make the coffee diplomat, warm the milk, the 300ml cream and coffee in a pan over a low heat until just steaming (don't let it boil). Meanwhile, brieflywhiskthe vanilla, cornflour, caster sugar and egg yolks together in a large bowl until just combined. Slowly pour the hot milk mixture over the egg yolk mixture, whisking continuously. Strain the mixture through a sieve back into the saucepan, then set over a low-medium heat and cook, stirring continuously with a rubber spatula to prevent the mixture from burning, for 4-5 mins. Don’t rush this as the eggs can easily scramble. After this time, the custard should be thick and smooth. Remove the pan from the heat, scrape the custard into a clean bowl, cover the surface and chill for 1-2 hrs until completely cold.
- For the praline, toast the hazelnuts in the oven as you did the nuts in step 1. Lightly oil a baking tray. Weigh the sugar out into a pan and set over a medium heat. Cook, without stirring, until the sugar has dissolved and turned from amber to deep caramel – you can swirl the pan occasionally, but don't stir. Tip in the toasted hazelnuts and swirl to coat in caramel, then tip onto the oiled baking tray. Sprinkle over a pinch of salt and leave to set until hard, about 20 mins. Once set, break the praline into shards and blitz in a food processor to a coarse rubble.
- To make the ganache, put the chocolate and a pinch of salt in a heatproof bowl. Warm the cream in a saucepan over a low heat until just steaming, then pour this over the chocolate. Leave to stand for 3-4 mins until the chocolate has melted, then stir into a thick, glossy ganache. Leave to cool at room temperature until needed.
- When the coffee diplomat has cooled and set, beat it with aspatulato loosen slightly, then fold in the 100ml lightly whipped cream, a spoonful at a time, until fully incorporated. Spoon into a piping bag fitted with a round nozzle.
- Put one meringue disc on a plate, sticking it down with a small blob of the coffee diplomat. Spread half the ganache over the meringue, then pipe over a third of the diplomat. Repeat once, then top with the final meringue and pipe the rest of the diplomat on top. Scatter over the praline rubble, then decorate with gold leaf or lustre, if you like.Best eaten straightaway, but will keep chilled for up to three days.
