## Chocolate crumpets

**Description:** We've reinvented the classic crumpet for chocoholics. Follow our easy recipe and make the ultimate breakfast or sweet snack

**Prep Time:** 10 mins

**Cook Time:** 20 mins

**Difficulty:** More effort

**Serves:** Makes 8-10 crumpets

**Diet Type:** Freezable

### Nutrition Information
- **kcal:** 139
- **fat:** 4g
- **saturates:** 1g
- **carbs:** 21g
- **sugars:** 6g
- **fibre:** 1g
- **protein:** 4g
- **salt:** 0.03g

### Ingredients
- 300mlmilk
- 200gplain flour
- 2 tbspcocoa powder
- 1 tspfast-action dried yeast
- 2 tbspgolden caster sugar
- 2 tbspvegetable oil, plus extra for the pan

### Method
- Heat 300ml of the milk in a pan until it just starts to bubble around the edges, then leave it to cool until it is tepid.
- Measure out the flour and then put 3 tbsp back into the bag. Add the cocoa, yeast and sugar, and then stir in the milk, a little at a time, until you have a smooth batter. Cover and leave to rise in a warm place for 1hr-1hr 30 mins or until doubled in size and very bubbly. Stir in a little more milk if the batter is very thick – if it is too thick the bubbles won’t rise to the surface as well.
- When risen, add the remaining 50ml milk to the batter to let it down a little, then heat the grill to high. Lightly oil the insides of 4 x 9cm metal crumpet rings or metal cook's rings. Heat a large non-stick frying pan or griddle pan over a low-medium heat, add 1 tbsp oil and put the rings in the pan. Spoon the batter into the rings until they are half full. Let the crumpets cook slowly for about 10 mins or until the mixture has set and the bubbles on top have all popped. Lift the rings away carefully. Repeat with the remaining mixture.
- If you now want to grill the crumpets, transfer the pan (if it has a heatproof handle) to the grill and cook until the tops are golden brown. If the pan doesn't have a heatproof handle, transfer the crumpets to a baking sheet and grill them on that instead.Can be made up to a day ahead or frozen until ready to grill and serve.

**Cook Time:** 18 mins

**Difficulty:** Easy

**Serves:** Serves 1

**Diet Type:** Vegetarian

### Nutrition Information
- **kcal:** 528

- **saturates:** 4g
- **carbs:** 71g
- **sugars:** 42g
- **fibre:** 1g
- **protein:** 22g
- **salt:** 1.2g

### Ingredients
- 2 largeeggs, separated
- 2 tbspgolden caster sugar
- 1 tspvanilla extract
- 2 tbspmilk
- 2 tbspself-raising flour
- 1 tspvegetable oil
- butter, icing sugar and maple syrup, to serve

### Method
- Whisk the egg whites in a clean bowl with 1 tbsp sugar using an electric whisk or astand mixerto form stiff peaks.
- Beat the egg yolks, 1 tbsp sugar and vanilla together in a separate bowl until pale and foamy, and a ribbon trail is left on the surface when the beaters are removed. Gently fold in the milk and flour until just incorporated.
- Fold the egg whites into the egg yolk mixture and gently turn the batter over to mix, using the side of a metal spoon orspatulato keep all the air in the mixture.
- Working fairly quickly, heat a largenon-stick frying panwith a lid over a very low heat. Drizzle a little oil into the pan, then wipe it with a piece of kitchen paper – you only want a small film on the base of the pan. Make three tall pancakes by piling three spoonfuls of the batter into the pan, using about two thirds of the mixture. Keep them piled quite high, don’t tip the pan or spread them out like you would normal pancakes. Cover with a lid and cook for 2-4 mins, the steam will help them set. Remove the lid and add another dollop of batter to each pancake, this will create the classic height and thickness. Return the lid and cook for another 8 mins until the top feels slightly set.
- Very gently, and carefully, turn the pancakes over in the pan with a fish slice or spatula. The bases should be a light golden brown. Add the lid back on and cook for another 4-6 mins until both sides are golden brown and they have a slight wobble, but are not collapsing or sticky. Serve with a pat of butter, a dusting of icing sugar and a little maple syrup.

- 100gbutter, very soft
- 225gicing sugar, plus more to dust
- 2 tbspcocoa powder

### Method
- Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Oil and line the base of two 18cm (or smaller) sandwich tins and a 1.2L pudding basin. Mix the self-raising flour, cocoa powder, bicarbonate of soda and sugar in a bowl. Make a well in the centre and beat in the golden syrup, eggs, oil and milk with an electric whisk, until smooth.
- Pour the mixture into the pudding basin until it is ¾ full, then divide the rest between the two sandwich tins and bake for 25-30 mins until the cakes are risen and firm to the touch. The sponge in the pudding basin may need longer depending on whether the basin is metal or ceramic. Cool for 10 mins before turning out onto a cooling rack to cool completely.
- Meanwhile, to make the icing, beat the butter until it is creamy. Beat in the icing sugar a little at a time, then beat in the cocoa powder and 2 tbsp water.
- Cut the pudding basin cake in half horizontally and sandwich it back together with a little icing. Put one of the round sponges on a cake board or plate and sandwich the other one on top with a little icing. Sandwich the pudding basin cake on top of the round cake. If the bottom cake sticks out beyond the bottom of the pudding basin cake, trim the top edge of the lower cake at an angle to make the sides flatter. Ice the outside of the cake with a thin layer of chocolate icing, using it all up.
- Roll the fondant out on a surface dusted with icing sugar to make a sheet shape that is big enough to cover the whole cake. Drape it carefully over the iced cake and press it around the top to make your ghost, with ruffles around the edges, cutting off the excess round the base. Colour some of the excess icing black by kneading in the food colouring, or use the black fondant icing. Roll it out to a few mm thick. Cut out eyes and a mouth and stick them on.

### Ingredients
- 7g sachetfast-action dried yeast
- 1 tspcaster sugar
- 500gplain flour
- ¼ tspcaraway seeds
- 200mlmilk
- 200gsoured cream
- 1½ litressunflower oil, plus extra for proving and brushing
- 300gsoured cream
- 250gbryzna cheese(also called bryndza cheese – similar to feta)
- small handful ofparsley, finely chopped
- To serve
- 300gsoured cream
- 250gbryzna cheese(also called bryndza cheese – similar to feta)
- small handful ofparsley, finely chopped

### Method
- Put the yeast, sugar, flour, caraway seeds and 1 tsp salt in a bowl, mix together and set aside. Whisk the milk and soured cream together in a jug, then pour into the dry ingredients and mix well until everything comes together. Knead by hand or using a stand mixer for 5-6 mins until it comes together into a cohesive, sticky dough.
- Lightly oil a clean bowl and tip in the dough. Lightly brush over a bit more oil, then cover and leave to rise in a warm spot for 1-3 hrs, or until doubled in size.
- Pour the 1½ litres of oil into a large deep pan, ensuring it is no more than a third full, and heat to 170C over a medium heat, or until a cube of bread browns within 20-30 seconds. Lightly oil a clean work surface, your hands and a rolling pin, then cut the dough into 16 pieces. Roll each one out into a circle, then lift and pull using your hands until thin in the middle and thicker at the edge, like a pizza base.
- Line a baking tray with baking parchment. Carefully lay the dough circles into the hot oil, fry for 1 min, then carefully turn and fry for a further 1-2 mins until golden all over (you'll need to do this in batches – you may be able to fry two at a time). Transfer the fried lángos to the lined tray and keep warm in a low oven. Spread over the soured cream and top with the brynza and parsley to serve.
