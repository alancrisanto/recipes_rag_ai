- 80gplain flour
- 40ghazelnuts, blitzed until fine
- For the craquelin
- 100gbutter, softened
- 120glight brown soft sugar
- 80gplain flour
- 40ghazelnuts, blitzed until fine
- 300mlmilk
- 5egg yolks(freeze the whites to use in another recipe)
- 60gcaster sugar
- 30gcornflour
- 150ghazelnut butter
- 225gbutter, softened
- For the hazelnut mousseline
- 300mlmilk
- 5egg yolks(freeze the whites to use in another recipe)
- 60gcaster sugar
- 30gcornflour
- 150ghazelnut butter
- 225gbutter, softened

### Method
- First, make the craquelin. Combine the butter, sugar, flour and hazelnuts in a bowl, then spread out over a sheet of baking parchment. Cover with another sheet of parchment and roll the mixture out until it's 2mm thick. Put in the freezer to chill while you prepare the choux.
- While the craquelin chills, sift the flour onto a sheet of baking parchment and fold in half (you will use the parchment as a funnel for adding the flour). Pour the milk, sugar, ½ tsp salt and the butter into a pan with 150ml water. Bring to the boil, then remove from the heat and quickly tip in the flour using the parchment as a funnel. Quickly and vigorously stir in the flour using a whisk. Return the pan to a low heat and, using a wooden spoon, stir for 1 min, beating well. The dough should start to come away from the bottom of the pan easily. Transfer the mixture to a stand mixer and beat for 30 seconds to cool slightly (or do this with an electric whisk in a bowl). Slowly pour in the egg, beating continuously using the mixer or whisk while checking the consistency of the dough – it should be smooth and silky, and you may not need all the egg. When ready, the dough should be able to slowly drop off a wooden spoon. (You can also mix in the egg by hand using a wooden spoon.)
- Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Spoon the choux into a piping bag fitted with a large round nozzle. Draw 14-16 circles over two sheets of baking parchment using an 8cm round biscuit cutter as a guide, then flip over and use to line two large baking trays (you should get at least 14 mini Paris-Brest, but may get up to 16, depending on your mixture). Pipe rings of choux inside the circle templates, leaving the middles clear. Stamp out 14-16 circles of craquelin using the same 8cm cutter, then use a 5cm cutter to stamp out the middles to make rings. Put these on top of the piped choux, then bake for 30-35 mins until risen, golden and completely dry – they should sound hollow when gently tapped, and feel light. Remove from the oven and leave to cool completely on the baking trays.
- For the mousseline, pour the milk into a pan and warm over a low heat, swirling the pan to ensure it doesn’t catch, until it just starts to steam. Combine the egg yolks, sugar and cornflour in a heatproof bowl using a whisk. Slowly whisk in the hot milk, then pour back into the pan and return to a medium heat. Continue to whisk until the mixture thickens, then whisk in the hazelnut butter and a large pinch of salt. Remove from the heat and spread the mixture out over a plate to cool completely. Once cooled, tip the butter into a bowl and beat using an electric whisk until smooth and creamy. Add half the cooled hazelnut mixture and beat well, then beat in the rest until smooth and just holding its shape.
- To assemble the individual Paris-Brests, cut the choux pastry rings in half through the equator using a serrated knife. Spoon the hazelnut mousseline into a piping bag fitted with a small round or fluted nozzle, and pipe into the bottom half of the choux. Sandwich with the top half and generously dust with icing sugar.

### Ingredients
- 1egg, separated
- 75gplain flour
- 1 tspbaking powder
- 1 tbspcaster sugar
- 100mlmilk
- 1 tbspneutral-tasting oil
- 250g15%-fat beef mince

- 10small cardboard boxes (16 x 9cm; we used kids’ party lunchboxes)
- You’ll also need
- green card (30 x 35cm)
- white acrylic paint and a paint brush, or a white paint pen
- 2goals and players, made from cardboard (or use mini figures)
- 10small cardboard boxes (16 x 9cm; we used kids’ party lunchboxes)

### Method
- Put the green card on a serving table – it will be hard to move the stadium once assembled, so set it up where you want to serve it. Paint or draw a border around the edges using paint or a paint pen, then paint or draw the halfway line, centre circle and penalty areas. Decorate with the cardboard goals and players or mini figures. (If you’re using chocolate footballs, you can also put one of these on the “pitch”.)
- Cut the top flaps off the cardboard boxes so they’re open, then cut diagonally along the sides for a tiered effect – the front of the boxes should be 4-5cm in height (to sit against the pitch) and the back, 10cm. Arrange the boxes around the pitch.
- Fill the boxes with the chocolate footballs, cheese cubes, grapes, carrots, cucumbers, celery, peppers, crisps, popcorn, and tomatoes, and serve alongside dips, if you like.

- ½ tbspbrown sugaror ground or grated jaggery (if using a block)
- 1 tbspmelted ghee(or ½ tbsp sunflower oil mixed with ½ tbsp melted unsalted butter)
- 2 tbspGreek yogurt(or vegan alternative)
- For the dough
- pinch ofsaffron
- 330gself-raising flour,plus extra for dusting
- 1 tspbaking powder
- ½ tbspbrown sugaror ground or grated jaggery (if using a block)
- 1 tbspmelted ghee(or ½ tbsp sunflower oil mixed with ½ tbsp melted unsalted butter)

- 1 tbspchopped pistachios
- 1 tbsp warmmilkmixed with 1 tsp rosewater
- 1 tbspmelted ghee
- 1 tbspflaked almonds
- 1 tbspcrystallised rose petals(optional)
- To garnish
- 1 tbspchopped pistachios
- 1 tbsp warmmilkmixed with 1 tsp rosewater
- 1 tbspmelted ghee
- 1 tbspflaked almonds
- 1 tbspcrystallised rose petals(optional)

### Method
- For the dough, soak the saffon in 2 tbsp hot water for 20 mins before you begin. Mix all the filling ingredients in a bowl until it's a thick paste and set aside.
- Combine all the flour, baking powder, a pinch of sea salt and the brown sugar or jaggery in a large bowl. Make a well in the centre and pour in the melted ghee and yogurt.
- Pour in 150ml warm water and use a fork to mix the water, yogurt and ghee together without disturbing the flour. Slowly bring the flour to the centre, little by little (using a fork or your fingers) to make a sticky dough, then knead for at least 7-10 mins or until soft, smooth and pliable. If it is still sticky, don't add more flour. Once kneaded, add a little oil or ghee to your hands and cover the dough’s surface with it. Put the dough back in the bowl, cover with a tea towel and leave to rest for at least 20-30 mins.
- Divide the dough into six equal balls, set them aside on a clean worktop and cover with a tea towel. Divide the filling into six equal portions and set aside.
- Dust your worktop with flour, then take a dough ball and press it with your fingers to make a circle about 10cm wide. Spoon 30-40g filling into the middle and pinch the dough together to form a dumpling-like ball. Make sure all the filling is enclosed inside as you don’t want it escaping when youroll the naan out.
- To roll out the naans, use a rolling pin and gently roll out the filled naan from the centre to the edges carefully – try not to apply much pressure. Use your hands to keep moving the dough around so it does not stick to the surface. Roll out until about 20cm wide. Sprinkle some of the chopped pistachios on top.
- There are two cooking methods you can use – over a gas hob or in the oven. To cook on a gas hob and replicate the tandoor effect, heat a stainless-steel tawa pan or frying pan (do not use non-stick as you want the bread to stick to it when you flip the pan), until hot. Turn the naan over carefully, wet the back of it with plain water, then carefully place on the heated tawa/frying pan. Place the pan on the hob, cook for about 1 min or until small bubbles appear on the surface of the naan, then brush the warm rosewater-milk on top. Lift the pan and flip it (with the bread stuck to the pan), holding it directly over the flame – it won't fall off because the water ensures it sticks on (this is what happens in a tandoor). Cook over the open flame evenly until it starts to go dark and charred in places. Gently remove the naan with a metalspatula,then brush with melted ghee and sprinkle over the remaining pistachios, flaked almonds and crystallised rose petals now, if using. Serve immediately or wrap in foil to keep soft. Repeat with the rest of the dough balls.
- To cook in the oven, heat the oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 8 or the hottest it can get and turn the grill on too. Using an oven-proof tray, line with baking parchment, place the naan on top and brush with the warm milk and rosewater mixture. Put in the oven on the middle shelf for about 6-8 mins. Keep an eye on it and make sure you don't let it burn. Once cooked, brush with ghee and sprinkle over the remaining pistachios and flaked almonds, and the crystallised rose petals, if using. Serve immediately or keep wrapped in foil while you continue cooking the rest.

- **sugars:** 15g
- **fibre:** 3g
- **protein:** 32g
- **salt:** 7.64g

### Ingredients
- 2boneless chicken thighs
- 2chicken breasts
- thumb-sized piece ofginger, thinly sliced
- 2 tbspdashi powderor 1 piece of dried kombu (5cm square)
- 1 whole smallgarlic bulb, cloves peeled
- 150mlsoy sauce
- 4 tbspsaké
- 4 tbspmirin
- 2 tbspdark brown sugar
- 2 litreschicken stock
- 100-130gfresh ramen noodles(or 80g -100g per serving if using dried ramen noodles)

- For the toppings
- 3 soft-boiledeggs
- 1 sheet ofnori (seaweed sheet)
- 2spring onions
- shichimi(Japanese seven spice) (optional)

### Method
- First make the chashu. Wrap the chicken thighs around the breasts and secure with toothpicks or string to make a cylindrical shape – you may need to flatten the thighs a little by bashing them with arolling pin. In a very hot pan, sear the chicken on each side until golden brown, around 25 mins in total.
- Transfer the chicken to a medium pan with a lid and add the ginger, dashi powder, garlic, soy sauce, saké, mirin and sugar, plus 150ml water. Cover and bring to the boil, then reduce to medium-low and simmer for 30-40 mins. Remove the lid and leave to cool.If you want to make it ahead, chill the chicken and sauce overnight, or at least for a few hours. It will improve the flavour.Once cooled, remove the chicken from the sauce, slice it and set the sauce aside.
- Pour 240ml of the sauce into a large pan (freeze the rest to use another time), bring to the boil, add the chicken stock and heat through.
- In a separate pan filled with boiling water, cook the noodles following pack instructions, then drain.
- Divide the chicken stock and noodles between six bowls. Put the sliced chicken, half a boiled egg and any other toppings you're using on top. Serve immediately, otherwise the noodles will go soggy.

- Slice the chicken thigh fillets intobite-sized chunksthen put in a bowl with the light soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, oyster sauce, white pepper, cornflour, egg and ½ tsp salt. Mix well, cover, then leave to marinate in the fridge for 1 hr.
- To make the batter, combine the cornflour, plain flour, white pepper and ½ tsp salt in a large bowl. Add the marinated chicken and mix until all the pieces are evenly coated.
- Fill a deep pan with 4-5cm of vegetable oil, ensuring it is no more than a third full, and heat on high until a drop of batter sizzles quickly when dropped in. Lower the heat to medium and carefully add the chicken pieces in batches. Fry for 5 mins, until golden and cooked through. Transfer the cooked chicken to a plate lined with kitchen paper as you go. Allow the chicken to rest for 5 mins, then heat the oil again and fry it for a further 1-2 mins to ensure maximum crispiness. Transfer again to a plate lined with kitchen paper.
- Make the sauce by combining the light soy sauce, sesame oil, brown sugar, honey, ketchup, garlic and ginger along with 5 tbsp water in a pan over a medium-low heat. Once the sauce is simmering, mix the cornflour with 3 tsp water, add to the pan and stir until thickened. Stir in the chicken to coat each piece in the sauce. Garnish with the spring onion and sesame seeds to serve.

## Brown stew chicken
**Link:** https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/brown-stew-chicken

**Description:** Try a staple Jamaican stew. The browning comes from ‘burning sugar’ – taking it beyond caramelisation to season the dish

**Prep Time:** 25 mins

**Cook Time:** 1 hr and 15 mins

**Difficulty:** Serves 4 - 6

**Serves:** No Serves

**Diet Type:** Egg-free

### Nutrition Information
- **kcal:** 342
- **fat:** 18g
- **saturates:** 5g
- **carbs:** 8g
- **sugars:** 7g
- **fibre:** 1g
- **protein:** 36g
- **salt:** 2.86g

### Ingredients
- 1 wholechicken, approx 1.2kg
- 1white onion, halved and thinly sliced
- thumb-sized piece ofginger, grated
- 3garlic cloves, crushed
- 3 sprigs ofthyme
- 1 tbspground pimento(also known as allspice)
- 5 tspcaster sugar
- 1 tbspsoy sauce
- 1red pepper, sliced
- 1 tbspall-purpose seasoning
- 2 tbsptomato ketchup
- 1scotch bonnet pepper
- 2spring onions, roughly chopped
- 500mlchicken stock

### Method
- Quarter the chicken, remove the wings and separate the legs and thighs, then cut each breast into three pieces. (You can keep the carcass chilled to make stock another day.)
- Season the chicken with the pimento, onion, all purpose seasoning, soy sauce, 1 tsp black pepper and 1½ tsp salt.
- Add the sugar to a large pan and cook over a medium heat. Wait until the sugar starts to melt, keeping an eye on it as it starts to bubble and darken. Once it’s dark brown and has gone just beyond the smell of caramel, add the chicken pieces, shaking off as much of the onion as possible.
- Cook the chicken in batches to brown all over and remove to a pan while you cook the next batch. Once all the chicken is browned, remove from the pan and add the onion, garlic, ginger, spring onion, thyme and a pinch of salt, scraping the bowl to remove any trace of spices. Cook for 5-8 mins until the onion is soft, then return the chicken to the pan. Stir well and add the stock, scotch bonnet and tomato ketchup and top up with 100ml water. Put a lid on and cook for 20 mins. Remove the lid, add the red pepper and cook for another 20-25 mins until the sauce has thickened and the chicken has cooked through. Remove the scotch bonnet and discard, taste for seasoning and serve with rice.

**Description:** A stunning celebration cake of six or seven colourful layers with soft cheese frosting – this vibrant rainbow cake is an impressive showstopper

**Prep Time:** 2 hrs

**Cook Time:** 1 hr

**Difficulty:** A challenge

**Serves:** Cuts into 18 slices

**Diet Type:** Freezable (un-iced sponges only)

### Nutrition Information
- **kcal:** 614
- **fat:** 30g
- **saturates:** 18g
- **carbs:** 75g
- **sugars:** 46g
- **fibre:** 2g
- **protein:** 9g
- **salt:** 1.36g

### Ingredients
- 125gbutter, softened, plus a little extra for the tin
- 225gself-raising flour
- 150ggolden caster sugar
- 3medium eggs(very important to use the correct size)
- 1 tspbaking powder
- pinch of salt
- 1 tspvanilla extract
- 1 tbspmilk, optional if batter is too stiff
- edible food colouring- red, orange, yellow, green, blue and purple, plus optional pink (see below)
- You'll need 3 x these ingredients for six sponges
- 125gbutter, softened, plus a little extra for the tin
- 225gself-raising flour
- 150ggolden caster sugar
- 3medium eggs(very important to use the correct size)
- 1 tspbaking powder
- pinch of salt
- 1 tspvanilla extract
- 1 tbspmilk, optional if batter is too stiff
- edible food colouring- red, orange, yellow, green, blue and purple, plus optional pink (see below)
- 1 tspvanilla extract
- 750gsoft cheeseor mascarpone
- 350gicing sugar
- For the icing
- 1 tspvanilla extract
- 750gsoft cheeseor mascarpone
- 350gicing sugar

### Method
- Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Butter 2 x 20cm round sandwich tins and line the bases with baking parchment. Tip all the sponge ingredients, apart from the food colouring, into a mixing bowl, then beat with an electric whisk until smooth.
- Working quickly, weigh the mixture into another bowl to work out the total weight, then weigh exactly half the mixture back into the mixing bowl. Pick two of your colours and stir a little into each mix. Keep going until you are happy with the colour – the colour of the batter now will be very similar to the finished cake, so be brave! Scrape the different batters into the tins, trying to spread and smooth as much as possible – but try not to waste a drop of the batter – a rubber spatula will help you. Bake on the same oven shelf for 15-20 mins until a skewer poked into the middle comes out clean. Don't worry if the sponges are thin, there are many layers.
- Gently turn the cakes out onto a wire rack to cool. Wash the tins and bowls thoroughly, and start again from step 1 – this time using another two colours. Unless you’re making the optional pink layer, repeat one more time to get 6 sponges, all of different colours. Leave them all to cool.
- To make the icing, very briefly beat the vanilla and soft cheese or mascarpone with an electric whisk until smooth. Sift in the icing sugar and gently fold in with a spatula. Be careful – the more you work it, the runnier it will get, increasing the chance of splitting.
- Smear a little icing on your cake stand or plate – just a splodge to stick the first sponge. Start with the red, then spread with some icing right to the very edge. Repeat, sandwiching on top the orange, yellow, green, blue and finally purple sponges. Spread the remaining icing thickly all over the sides and top of the cake.

**Description:** Enjoy tender shredded pork on corn tortillas with salsa and chopped coriander. This recipe is inspired by the staple Mexican dish and is easy to make at home

**Prep Time:** 15 mins

**Cook Time:** 4 hrs and 30 mins

**Difficulty:** Easy

**Serves:** Serves 6

**Diet Type:** Egg-free

### Nutrition Information
- **kcal:** 326
- **fat:** 10g
- **saturates:** 2g
- **carbs:** 21g
- **sugars:** 19g
- **fibre:** 3g
- **protein:** 36g
- **salt:** 0.46g

### Ingredients
- 1½ tbspvegetable oil
- 2red onions, roughly chopped
- 1whole garlic bulb, cut in half
- 2 tspdried oregano
- 2 tspground cumin
- 1 tspchilli powder
- 2bay leaves
- 4limes, juiced
- 2oranges, juiced
- 4 tbsplight brown soft sugar
- 700mlbeef stock
- 1kgpork shoulder
- 1onion, roughly chopped
- corn tortillas, chopped coriander and salsa, to serve

### Method
- Heat 1 tbsp of the vegetable oil in largesaucepanover a medium heat and cook the red onions for 10-12 mins, stirring occasionally until softened and caramelised. Add the halved garlic bulbs, cut-side down, along with the oregano, cumin, chilli powder and bay leaves. Tip in three-quarters of the lime juice and the orange juice. Stir in the sugar, turn up the heat and continue to cook until the base has caramelised, about 3-5 mins. Pour in the stock and nestle in the pork. Top up with water so the pork is submerged, then cover and simmer over a low heat for 3-4 hrs until the meat is completely tender and falling apart.
- Remove the pork to a board and set aside. Turn the heat up to high and reduce the cooking liquor by two thirds. (This helps intensify the flavour.) Once the liquid has reduced, remove the lime and orange halves with a slotted spoon and discard.
- Shred the pork using two forks and transfer to an ovenproof dish. Heat the grill to high. Drizzle the remaining ½ tbsp vegetable oil over the pork and grill for 5-10 mins, or until the pork is crispy and charred. Add ladlefuls of the reduced cooking liquor to the pork and toss until it’s well-coated. Combine the chopped onion and remaining lime juice in a bowl with a pinch of salt. Serve the shredded pork in corn tortillas, topped with the onion mixture, salsa and chopped coriander, with the remaining sauce on the side for dipping, if you like.Once cool, the remaining sauce can be frozen for up to three months to use as a base for soups or stews.

### Method
- Start by making the mojo pork. Tip all the ingredients, except the pork, into afood processorwith 1 tsp salt and a good grinding of black pepper. Blitz until finely chopped. Or, you can finely chop everything by hand. Pour into a large bowl or food bag and add the pork, turning it to coat well. If you've got time, leave to marinate in the fridge for at least 8 hrs, or up to 24 hrs. This is optional, but results in better flavour and makes the pork more tender. (If you don't have time to marinate, continue to step two.)
- Heat the oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Put the pork in aroasting tinalong with any leftover marinade, then cover tightly with foil. Roast for 30 mins, then reduce the heat to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and roast for a further 1 hr 30 mins. (Or, see tip below for cooking in a pressure cooker.) Remove from the oven and leave to cool, then slice thinly. If you don't have time to leave it to cool, shred it using two forks (you won't be able to slice it neatly while still warm).Once cool, will keep chilled for up to three days in an airtight container.
- Brush the base of each panini with a little of the melted butter, then top with the mustard, sliced mojo pork, ham, gruyère and pickles. Sandwich with the tops of the panini, then brush the base and top with the remaining melted butter. Transfer the sandwiches to a large frying pan over a low heat, then put a flat saucepan lid on top to squish the sandwiches together. Put a heavy pan or can on top to weigh it down, and cook on each side for 4-5 mins until golden and the cheese is melted. Cut in half to serve.
