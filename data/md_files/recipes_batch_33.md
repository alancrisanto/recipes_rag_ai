**Difficulty:** More effort

**Diet Type:** Vegetarian

### Nutrition Information

- **carbs:** 19g
- **sugars:** 13g
- **fibre:** 1g
- **protein:** 0.5g
- **salt:** 0.01g

### Ingredients
- 500gmedium fresh chestnuts
- 300ggranulated sugar
- ½vanilla pod, split lengthways (optional)

### Method
- First, score the shells of the chestnuts. If you’re comfortable doing so, use a curvedparing knifeto cut a U-shape through the shell, being careful not to cut into the flesh of the nut: starting at the flat base, cut vertically up one of the narrow sides to the pointy top, then back down the other side to the base. Alternatively, use a sharp knife or kitchen scissors to cut or snip a cross the full length and width of the base of the shell.
- Put the chestnuts in a saucepan and cover with boiling water from thekettle. Simmer for 10 mins, then turn off the heat. Lift the chestnuts out one at a time using a spoon, then peel off both the outer shell and papery skin. (Rubbing with a dry tea towel can help remove the skin.)
- Bring the sugar and 300ml water to the boil, stirring occasionally. Once the sugar has melted, scrape in the seeds of the vanilla pod (if using) and drop in the pod itself. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for 5 mins, then add the chestnuts and simmer for a further 10 mins. Turn off the heat, cover and leave for 24 hrs.
- The next day, return the syrup to the boil and bubble for 1 min. Remove from the heat, cover and leave for 24 hrs. Repeat this boiling and soaking process twice more.
- Heat the oven to 120C/100C fan/gas 1/2. Lift the chestnuts out of the syrup, one at a time, and transfer to abaking traylined with baking parchment. Transfer the tray to the preheated oven, then immediately turn the oven off. Leave the chestnuts to dry in the oven with the door closed for 1 hr. If they’re still wet after this time, leave in a warm place until fully dry. Once dry to the touch, wrap in individual squares of parchment and store in an airtight tin.Will keep for up to two months in an airtight container.

- For the pastry, combine the plain flour, fine sea salt, icing sugar and cold butter in afood processor,then pulse to fine breadcrumbs. Or rub the butter into the flour using your fingers. In a small bowl, mix 3 tbsp cold water with the egg yolks, add to the mix and pulse or stir in to combine – add up to another 2 tbsp water if the mixture still feels dry. Tip into a bowl, shape into a ball, then cover and chill for 30 mins.
- On a lightly floured surface,roll out the pastryto a 27cm circle about the thickness of a £1 coin. Run a palette knife underneath it every now and then so that it doesn’t stick. Use to line a 23cm fluted tart tin, leaving an overhang of about 1cm and freeze for 20 mins. Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6.
- Cover the pastry with baking parchment, fill with baking beans or uncooked rice and bake for 15 mins. Remove the parchment and beans, prick the base of the tart with a fork and bake for 7-10 mins until the pastry has turned slightly darker. Trim the overhang with aserrated knife.

Cut the tops off the teabags and tip the tea leaves into the butter and sugar mix along with the sea salt, ground almonds, beaten eggs and self-raising flour and beat for another minute until the mixture just comes together.
- Spread the marmalade over the pastry using a spoon. Top with the frangipane, working from the centre and leaving a 5mm gap around the edge for it to expand. Be gentle and try not to mix the frangipane with the marmalade for a defined layer when you cut it. Scatter over the flaked almonds and bake for 40 mins or until golden (cover with foil after 30 mins if it’s colouring too quickly). Leave to cool in the tin, then dust with icing sugar.Will keep for up to three days. Cut into slices and serve with extra-thick cream.

### Method
- Heat 25g of the butter in a frying pan over a medium heat until sizzling, add the wild garlic leaves, season with salt and cook for 5 mins until completely wilted and soft. Leave to cool, then tip onto a board, roughly chop and set aside.
- Melt the rest of butter in a frying pan over a medium heat. Tip in the leeks and chicken, season and cook for 10-12 mins until the chicken is just cooked and the leeks have softened. Stir in the flour and cook for 3 mins until the mix resembles a sandy paste. Pour in the wine and bubble for 1-2 mins until reduced by half, then add the stock and crème fraîche, bring to a simmer and cook for 10 mins more until the chicken is cooked through. Stir through the cooked wild garlic and simmer for another 2-3 mins until thick and creamy. Season to taste, remove from the heat and, if you have any wild garlic stalks, finely slice them and stir through. Leave to cool completely, tip into a container and chill for 2 hrs, or overnight.Will keep chilled for up to two days.
- To make the pastry, rub the butter into the flour with a large pinch of salt using your fingertips until completely combined. Add half the beaten egg and 3 tbsp ice-cold water, and bring together into a dough using your hands, adding a little more water, 1 tbsp at a time, until you have a dough that’s soft enough to work with. Knead for a minute so it completely comes together, then chill for 1 hr.Will keep chilled for two days.

On a floured surface,roll outtwo-thirds of the pastry until it’s the thickness of a £1 coin and large enough to line the tin with some overhanging. Use it to line the tin, then spoon in the filling. Roll out the remaining pastry into a rough 25cm roughly circle. Brush the edge of the pastry with a little of the remaining beaten egg, then drape over the filling. Trim the edge, then crimp or press with a fork to seal the edges and use any pastry trimmings to decorate, if you like Chill until you’re ready to cook.Will keep chilled for up to 24 hrs.
- Heat the oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7 with a baking sheet inside. Brush the pie with some of the remaining beaten egg then, using asharp knife, lightly score a criss-cross pattern on top.
