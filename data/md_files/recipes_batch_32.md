- 1 tbspsoy sauce
- 600mlchicken or turkey stock
- For the gravy
- 2 tbspplain flour
- large glassred or white wine
- 1 tbspsoy sauce
- 600mlchicken or turkey stock

### Method
- Mash all the butter ingredients together in a bowl with a little salt and plenty of pepper, tip into a lidded container and cover until needed.Will keep for up to three days chilled, or frozen for a month.
- Up to 48 hrs and at least 12 hrs before cooking, loosen the skin of the turkey, over the breast, by pushing your hand beneath it. Season the turkey all over, including under the skin, with 1-2 tbsp flaky sea salt. (The further ahead you do this, the more succulent it will be.) Chop the turkey neck. Put the turkey in a largeroasting tinor on an oven tray, breast-side up, and chill, uncovered, until ready to cook.
- On the day of roasting, remove the turkey from the fridge at least 1 hr before cooking. Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Remove the turkey from the tin and tip the onions, carrots, turkey neck and giblets into the tin. If you have one, sit a roasting rack, trivet or ovenproof cooling rack in or over the tray and sit the turkey on top. Put the lemon halves in the cavity of the turkey with the garlic and rosemary. Spoon the flavoured butter under the turkey skin, spread it all over the breast meat and as far down to the legs as possible. For a neat finish, tie the wings and legs together using butcher’s string. Drizzle half the oil over the turkey and rub it all over.
- Put the turkey in the oven, roast for 1 hr, then remove, drizzle with the remaining oil, then return to the oven, turning the tin around, for another 1 hr. When the turkey has had 1 hr 45 mins in total, check it using atemperature probe thermometer– the timings differ depending on how long you’ve salted your turkey for and what breed of turkey you’re roasting. (If you don’t have a probe, see our tips, below.) Perfection is when the thickest part of the breast is about 65C and the thickest part of the thigh is 75C. If the temperature is lower, return the turkey to the oven for 15-min intervals and check again. Leave the turkey to cool for 10 mins on the rack, then use tongs to remove the lemon and garlic from the cavity and transfer to a board that has a moat or a platter to collect the resting juices. Leave to rest for at least another 20 mins (it will remain hot for at least 40 mins).
- Meanwhile, make the gravy. If the roasting tin you cooked the turkey in is flameproof, put it straight on a medium heat, if not tip the contents into a large, shallow pan and put on the heat with the cooked lemon halves, garlic and rosemary sprigs. Scatter over the flour, stir to make a paste, then stir in the wine and soy sauce and sizzle for about 5 mins until it’s a thick paste. Stir in the stock and all the turkey resting juices and simmer for 5 mins, stirring all the time. Strain the gravy into a jug or another pan to reheat when needed. Carve the turkey and serve with your choice of sides, or carve at the table.

### Ingredients
- plain flour, to dust
- ½ batch ofuniversal dough(see below)
- red food colouring paste
- 50gdemerara sugar

### Method
- Line a baking sheet with baking parchment. Lightly dust a clean work surface with flour and divide thedoughinto two. Beat the red food colouring into one batch of dough in a bowl using electric beaters until it’s vibrant red. Divide both lots of dough into two pieces each and chill them for 15 mins.
- On the dusted work surface,roll outinto four 1cm-thick rectangles, keeping them as straight-edged as possible – a dough scraper or palette knife can help with this. Lay the sheets of dough on top of each other, alternating colours and chill in the fridge until firm, around 30 mins. Trim the edges and cut into strips 1cm thick, then lay the strips on top of each other, alternating the colours, so that a red strip sits on top of plain and vice versa, and brushing lightly with a bit of water to help them stick. Put on a baking tray and chill in the fridge for 1 hr.
- Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6 and line two large baking sheets with baking parchment. Using a verysharp knife, cut into squares and lightly brush the edges with water. Dip the edges in the demerara sugar then arrange on a baking tray. Bake for 8-10 mins until golden and set. Leave to cool on the tray for 10 mins, before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.Will keep in an airtight container for three days.

- **saturates:** 0g
- **carbs:** 99g
- **sugars:** 26g
- **fibre:** 3g
- **protein:** 6g
- **salt:** 3.7g

### Ingredients
- 120mlrice vinegar or brown rice vinegar
- 3 tbspsugarseasoning, to taste (optional)
- 1 tbspsea salt
- For the sushi-su
- 120mlrice vinegar or brown rice vinegar
- 3 tbspsugarseasoning, to taste (optional)
- 1 tbspsea salt
- 450gJapanese rice(3 Japanese cups)
- 550g/mlwater
- For the rice
- 450gJapanese rice(3 Japanese cups)
- 550g/mlwater

### Method
- To make the rice, first wash it thoroughly in a sieve for 2 mins, gently turning it over by hand until the water runs clear. Drain the rice and put it in a pan with 550ml water.
- Leave it to stand for a minimum of 30 mins. It can be left overnight, but for best results, leave it for 30 mins-1 hr. Bring the water in the pan to the boil, put the lid on, reduce the heat and simmer for 8-9 mins. Turn the heat off and let it stand with the lid on for a further 5 mins. Do not lift the lid.
- While the rice is cooking, to make the sushi-su, put the rice vinegar, sugar and salt into a small container and mix with a spoon until the sugar and salt have dissolved.
- Put the rice into a wide flat dish such as a sushi oke, a baking dish or a roasting tray. Pour the sushi-su over the rice and fold it carefully in with a wooden spoon as it cools down, being careful not to damage the grains. You can use a fan or a hairdryer on the coolest setting to speed up the cooling process, directing it at the rice. The sushi-su gives the rice more flavour and that familiar sticky glazed look.
- If you don’t want to use the rice immediately, cover it with a damp cloth so that it doesn’t dry out. Leave in a cool place for up to 2 hrs. Do not refrigerate as the fridge will make the rice dry and hard to shape.Once assembled, the sushi can be chilled for a day.
