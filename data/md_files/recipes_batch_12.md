### Ingredients
- 120gself-raising flour
- 25gcocoa powder
- 100gcaster sugar
- 1 tspbaking powder
- 10gcornflour
- ½ tspbicarbonate of soda
- 75mlwhole oat milk
- 110mlaquafaba
- 50mlvegetable oil
- 1 tspvanilla extract
- 2 tbspicing sugar, plus extra for dusting
- 200mlplant-based double cream, plus extra to serve (optional)
- 1 tspvanilla extract
- For the filling
- 2 tbspicing sugar, plus extra for dusting
- 200mlplant-based double cream, plus extra to serve (optional)
- 1 tspvanilla extract
- 250gsilken tofu
- 150gdark chocolate, broken into pieces
- 2 tbspmaple syrup
- For the chocolate ganache
- 250gsilken tofu
- 150gdark chocolate, broken into pieces
- 2 tbspmaple syrup

### Method
- Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and line a swiss roll tin (approx. 32cm x 22cm) with baking parchment.
- First, make the ganache by combining the silken tofu and dark chocolate in a medium saucepan over a low heat, stirring until the chocolate has melted – it will look lumpy at this stage but don’t worry. Add the maple syrup, vanilla extract and a pinch of salt, stir to combine and take off the heat. Use an electric whisk to transform the mixture into a silky smooth ganache, about 2-3 mins. Transfer to a piping bag and put in the fridge to cool.
- To make the sponge, sift all the dry ingredients (flour, cocoa powder, caster sugar, baking powder, cornflour, bicarbonate of soda and ½ tsp salt) together in a mixing bowl. In a small jug, combine the oat milk and vinegar to create a vegan buttermilk. Set aside.
- In a separate mixing bowl, whisk the aquafaba until the liquid has transformed to soft peaks – be patient as this can take up to 5 mins. It’s best to use an electric handheld whisk or freestanding mixer.
- Add the vegetable oil and vanilla extract to the jug of oat milk and vinegar. Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl of dry ingredients and use large metal spoon to combine until you have a thick batter. Stir a third of the whipped aquafaba into the batter. Once the batter has loosened slightly, tip the chocolate batter into the bowl with the remaining aquafaba and fold through until combined, being careful not to knock too much air from the mixture. Pour this into the prepared baking tin, level out with a spatula, and bake for 20-22 mins.
- Leave the sponge in the tin to cool for 5 mins before turning it out onto a large piece of parchment dusted with 1 tbsp icing sugar. Peel off the top parchment used to line the tin and leave for a further 2-3 mins to cool slightly. While still slightly warm, use the baking parchment to roll the sponge from the short end, creating a log. Carefully unroll and allow to cool completely – rolling the sponge while slightly warm helps prevent large cracks. But don’t worry if there are small cracks as they’ll be hidden by the ganache.
- For the filling, whisk the icing sugar, vanilla extract and plant-based double cream in a bowl until soft peaks have formed. The sponge should now be cool. Spread an even layer of the cream over the flat sponge. Then, as before, roll the filled sponge into a log and use the baking parchment to hold in a log shape. Transfer to a plate or board and into the fridge for 30 mins-1 hr.
- When you are ready to decorate, carefully unwrap the yule log from the parchment. Snip the end of the piping bag and pipe thick horizontal lines to cover the sponge with chocolate ganache. Use a spoon to create a soft pillowy finish to the ganache, or a fork to create a bark-like effect. Finish with any accompanying decorations – berries, edible holly décor or a spritz of gold spray. Transfer to the fridge for at least 1 hr or until you’re ready to serve.
- Serve with more pouring cream and berries, if you like.

- For the ganache
- 100gdark chocolate(70% cocoa solids)
- 150gdouble cream

### Method
- Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Line the base of a deep 23cm springform cake tin with baking parchment.Whiskthe oil, milk, vanilla and egg together in a jug. Combine the flour, bicarb, cocoa and sugar in a bowl using an electric whisk. Add the wet ingredients to the dry, and whisk until smooth and just combined. Pour into the tin and bake for 18-20 mins until risen, firm and a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean. Cool in the tin for 10 mins, then turn out onto a wire rack, top-side down – this will help flatten it if it’s slightly domed.
- Meanwhile, make the custard. Put all the chocolate in a large heatproof bowl. Warm the 130ml milk and 350ml of the cream in a medium pan over a low heat until steaming. Combine the cornflour and the 1 tbsp milk in a medium bowl until smooth, then whisk in the eggs and sugar. Slowly pour in the warm cream mixture, whisking all the time. Wipe out the pan and return the custard to it. Warm gently, stirring continuously until the custard has thickened and reached 76C. Pour this over the chocolate and leave for a few minutes to melt, then stir until smooth. Stir in the liqueur, if using.
- Pour the custard into a bowl and cover with a disc of parchment. Cool. Once completely cool, whisk the rest of the cream to soft peaks and fold this into the custard.
- Clean the cake tin and line with parchment. If the sponge is domed, trim the top with aserrated knife. Put the sponge in the tin, bottom-side up. Spoon over the custard, smooth the surface and chill for 6 hrs to set.
- For the ganache, put the chocolate in a heatproof bowl. Warm the cream and glucose in a small pan over a low heat until the glucose has melted and the cream is steaming. Pour this over the chocolate. Leave for a few minutes, then stir until smooth. Cool at room temp until thick but still liquid. Pour this over the custard. Level the surface and chill for 2 hrs to set. Decorate with the stars and truffles, sprayed with gold spray.

**Difficulty:** More effort

**Serves:** Serves 10

**Diet Type:** Freezable (Freeze unfilled)

### Nutrition Information

- **saturates:** 22g
- **carbs:** 55g
- **sugars:** 35g
- **fibre:** 2g
- **protein:** 9g
- **salt:** 0.26g

### Ingredients
- 50gbutter, melted, plus extra for greasing
- 250gplain flour, plus extra for dusting
- 250gcaster sugarplus 1 tbsp
- 8medium eggs
- 600mlpot double cream
- 400gpunnet strawberries, halved
- 180gpunnet blueberries
- 150gpunnet raspberries
- icing sugar, to dust

### Method
- Heat oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5. Brush 2 x 20cm cake tins with melted butter, line the bases with baking paper, then dust well with flour tipping out any excess. Set aside.
- Put the sugar and eggs in a large heatproof bowl, then set it over a pan of barely simmering water. Whisk with an electric hand whisk for about 7 mins or until the mixture is pale and has trebled in volume. Remove from the heat, then slowly pour in the butter folding it in as you pour until it is completely mixed in.
- Gently fold the flour and a pinch of salt into the egg mixture, then pour into your prepared cake tins. Cook for 20 mins until the cake is golden and risen – a skewer pushed into the cake should come out clean. Allow the cakes to cool for a few mins in the tin, then remove and cool completely on a wire rack.
- Meanwhile, whip the cream until it just holds its shape, then set aside. Whizz about a quarter of the strawberries with 1 tbsp sugar until smooth, then fold this purée through the cream so you get a ripple effect.
- To assemble the cakes, cut each one in half horizontally. Put one sponge on a serving plate, spread a quarter of the cream mix on top, then dot a quarter of the blueberries and raspberries around the edge. Repeat this step two more times, put the last layer of cake on top (save a top half of cake for the top layer), spread the remaining cream over, then put the blueberries and raspberries around the edge and pile the strawberries in the centre. Dust with icing sugar just before you serve.

### Ingredients
- 3-4 tbspolive oil
- 6garlic cloves,thinly sliced

Toss the beef in the flour, add 1 tbsp more oil to the pan, then brown the meat in batches, adding the final tbsp oil if you need to. It should take about 5 mins to brown each batch properly.

This can now be chilled and frozen for up to 1 month.

## Turkish delight

**Description:** Make your own Turkish delight with our easy recipe. It makes a great gift for Christmas, or just treat yourself to something sweet

**Prep Time:** 5 mins

**Cook Time:** 1 hr

**Difficulty:** Easy

**Serves:** Serves 12

**Diet Type:** Gluten-free

### Nutrition Information

- **fat:** 0.4g
- **saturates:** 0g
- **carbs:** 60g
- **sugars:** 47g
- **fibre:** 0g
- **protein:** 0.1g
- **salt:** 0.01g

### Ingredients
- flavourless oilfor the tray
- 500ggranulated sugar
- ½ tspcream of tartar
- 120gcornflour,plus extra for dusting
- ½-1tsprosewater(or 2 tbsp rose syrup)
- pink food colouring,if not using the rose syrup
- icing sugar,for dusting

### Method
- Oil a shallow square metal or silicone baking tray, about 18 x 18cm. Put the sugar in a pan with the cream of tartar and 500ml water and heat gently at first, stirring so that the sugar melts. Then, turn up the heat and boil for 10-15 mins until the mixture is a little more syrupy. If you have a sugar thermometer, it should reach 115-118C.
- Stir the cornflour into 150ml water, then,whiskingall the time, pour it into the sugar syrup. Keep whisking, until everything combines to make a smooth, gloopy mix. Take out the whisk and start to stir with aspatulaor spoon over a medium heat. Keep stirring until the mixture is thick enough to see a clear line drawn through it with the spoon and it starts to leave the sides of the pan. It will be very thick and make big bubbles that burst as it cooks, so be careful. Once the cornflour mixture is fully incorporated, continue cooking for about 20 minutes or until it reaches the desired consistency. Test the mix by dropping a small amount into very cold water; it should form a ball that can be pressed gently when cold and that will feel a little springy.
- Stir in the rosewater or rose syrup and the food colouring, if using, then pour everything into the tray and level the top. Leave to cool and set for a minimum of 24 hours. Sieve some cornflour and icing sugar together over a board and carefully turn out the Turkish delight. Cover it with more icing sugar and cornflour and cut it into cubes with a sharpknife. Dust with yet more of the icing sugar mixture and move the pieces apart so they can dry.Can be stored openly or in small cardboard boxes or bags for up to 1 week.
