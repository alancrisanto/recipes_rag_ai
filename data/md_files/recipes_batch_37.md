## Classic California roll

**Description:** Make your own sushi with these restaurant favourites that look impressive with the contrast of salmon, avocado, orange fish roe and sesame seeds

**Prep Time:** 30 mins

**Difficulty:** More effort

**Serves:** Serves 1 - 2

- **saturates:** 2g
- **carbs:** 11g
- **sugars:** 0.2g
- **fibre:** 2g
- **protein:** 13g
- **salt:** 0.67g

### Ingredients
- 50gfresh, sushi-grade salmon fillet, 1cm thick, skinned and boned (ask your fishmonger to do this for you)
- 1 sheet ofnori
- 1 handfulcooked sushi rice, roughly 80g
- 1 tbsptobiko(flying fish roe) or masago (capelin roe), alternatively black or white sesame seeds
- wasabi(optional)
- ½avocado, stoned and skin removed, sliced into 1cm pieces
- 40gwhite crabmeat

### Instructions
- Slicethe salmon lengthways into 1cm-wide strips. Put a sheet of cling film underneath a sushi mat then put a sheet of nori onto the sushi mat, with the lines of the sheet lying horizontally across the mat. It does not matter if the shiny side is facing up or down – the nori won’t be seen in the finished roll.
- Wet your fingers slightly (damp fingers help when handling sticky sushi rice). Leave a space about 3-4cm from the bottom of the nori sheet. Spread the rice over the rest of the nori evenly and gently with your fingertips. You want roughly a 2mm layer. Do not press it onto the sheet.
- Sprinkle 1 tbsp of tobiko, masago or sesame seeds over the rice; this will end up on the outside of the roll. Carefully flip the nori over on the mat so the rice is now underneath and the nori is face-up. Put the wasabi, if using, and salmon in a single line at the bottom of the nori on the area without the rice, then add half the avocado strips alongside, followed by the crabmeat in a line next to the avocado. It should all fit on to the clear area of nori just below the rice.
- Holding the filling in place with your index fingers, start rolling the mat from the bottom edge of the nori towards the top of the rice edge. Keep rolling, holding the roll in place, 3 or 4 times, making sure that it's tightly rolling so that there are no gaps between the fillings and the nori.
- Put the sushi roll on a clean, dry chopping board. Gently cut each roll into 8 pieces with a sharp, wet knife, smoothly and quickly. It’s useful to keep fingers damp when handling and chopping. We recommend cleaning the knife after every cut to avoid the rice sticking.

- **saturates:** 2g
- **carbs:** 28g
- **sugars:** 10g
- **fibre:** 1g
- **protein:** 3g
- **salt:** 0.3g

### Ingredients
- 500gstrong bread flour
- 10gfast-action yeast
- 75gcaster sugar
- 75gsalted butter, softened and cut into cubes
- 100mlwhole milk, lukewarm
- 1egg, beaten
- vegetable oil, for deep-frying
- 150gicing sugar, sifted
- 1lemon, zested and juiced
- For the icing
- 150gicing sugar, sifted
- 1lemon, zested and juiced

### Instructions
- Whisk the flour, yeast, 1 tsp salt and sugar together in a largebowl. Toss the butter cubes into the floury mix and begin rubbing it in-between your fingertips – you are looking for flattened lumps, rather than breadcrumbs. Once the butter is well mixed, stir together the milk, 100ml water and an egg in a small jug until combined, then gradually pour into the flour.
- Begin bringing this together with a wooden spoon to form a rough dough. Keep working with floured hands until smooth. Cover and leave to rest for 1 hr in a warm spot.
- Knead the dough on a floured surface to make it a cohesive ball. Roll out into a long rectangle, about 40cm x 25cm long and 1.5cm thick. Fold one end up by a third and the other over the top, then rotate 90 degrees so it looks like a book. Roll this out to the same size as before, then rest in the fridge for 20 mins. Repeat once more. Wrap well, then put in the fridge to chill for 1 hr.
- Lightly flour a work surface and unwrap the dough. Cut into 10-12 strips around 2cm wide. Use a dough scraper or knife to cut a slit in the centre of each strip, leaving both ends untouched and whole. Twist each side of the strip round each other once, so you have a twisted shape like a plait. Put them on a tray lined with baking parchment and leave to rise in a warm spot for 1 hr, until doubled in size.
- Meanwhile, make the icing. Sift the icing sugar into a small bowl, thenwhiskin the lemon juice and zest. Set aside for later.
- Heat enough oil in a large, deep pan – enough to submerge the yum yums but no more than a third full – until it reaches 180C on a thermometer, or a cube of leftover dough browns in 30 seconds. Carefully lower two yum yums into the oil and cook for 2 mins on each side until golden.
- Remove from the oil using a slotted spoon, then leave to drain on awire rackwith kitchen paper underneath. Brush liberally with the lemon icing before serving warm.Best eaten on the day, but will keep in an airtight container for up to two days.

## Yuzu beer batter

**Description:** Try this crispy batter from Joelle Drummond of the Drop Bear Beer Co. It works well with fish, chicken or chunky veg

- **saturates:** 0.4g
- **carbs:** 16g
- **sugars:** 0.5g
- **fibre:** 1g
- **protein:** 3g
- **salt:** 0.7g

### Ingredients
- 120gplain flour
- 1 tspbaking powder
- ¼ tsppaprika(smoked or regular)
- 1egg
- 120mlcold yuzuor regular pale ale
- vegetable, rapeseed or groundnut oil, for deep-frying
- garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne pepper or herbs (dried or fresh)
- To season (optional)
- garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne pepper or herbs (dried or fresh)

### Instructions
- Whiskthe flour, baking powder, ½ tsp salt, ¼ tsp ground black pepper, and the paprika together in a bowl. If using additional seasonings, add them to the dry ingredients at this stage.
- Make a well in the centre of the dry ingredients and crack in the egg. Gradually pour in the cold beer, whisking gently. The mixture will become lumpy at first, but continue whisking until a smooth batter forms. Be careful not to overmix – a few lumps are fine.
- Chill the batter for 15-20 mins (to achieve a lighter texture). Heat 5-7cm of oil in a deep frying pan over a medium-high heat until it reaches 175C on a cooking thermometer, or a cube of bread dropped in browns in 30 seconds.
- Dip your choice of veg or protein (see tip, below) into the chilled batter, ensuring the batter fully coats it. Carefully lower the coated foods into the hot oil, one at a time, using tongs or a slotted spoon. Avoid overcrowding the pan, as this can lower the temperature of the oil and make the batter soggy. Fry in batches, if necessary, until golden brown and crispy, usually about 2-4 mins per side, depending on the thickness of what you’re frying.
- Use a slotted spoon to remove the food from the oil, and set aside on a plate lined with kitchen paper to absorb any excess oil. Season with a pinch of salt while still hot, and serve straightaway.

- Tip all the ingredients into a large bowl, add 1-1½ tsp freshly ground black pepper, then scrunch it all together with your hands for 5 mins. You might want to wear gloves to avoid staining your skin with the beetroot juices.
- Press the veg down in the bowl with your hands, then cover the surface and up the side of the bowl with a large sheet of compostable cling film or something reusable like a beeswax wrap. Now place another similar-sized bowl on top. Press down hard and add anything heavy (packs of rice or cans work well) to weigh it down so the juices rise to cover the surface. Cover again.
- Leave to ferment at room temperature for at least five days, but for maximum flavour, leave for one-five weeks (until the bubbling subsides).
- Check the sauerkraut. After a few days, you will see bubbles that have built up as it ferments. Give it a stir, then cover and weigh it down again as before. The cabbage will become increasingly sour the longer it’s fermented, so taste it now and again. When you like the flavour, transfer it tosterilised jarsand keep chilled.Will keep chilled for up to six months.

- 50gwhite chocolate(optional)

### Instructions
- Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Butter a 20cm square baking tin and line with baking parchment. Tip the oats into a heatproof bowl. Melt the butter, sugar, golden syrup, maple syrup (if using) and a pinch of sea salt together in a pan set over a low heat. When the sugar has dissolved after a few minutes, stir well and bubble briefly, then pour over the oats and stir to fully coat. Scrape the mixture into the tin and press down into an even layer using aspatula. Bake for 20 mins until just starting to brown. Leave to cool slightly.
- For the caramel layer, warm the condensed milk, butter and sugar in asaucepanover a low heat, stirring with a spatula until the butter has melted. Turn the heat up to medium and simmer for 8-10 mins, stirring continuously and scraping the base until the mixture has thickened and turned light brown – when it’s ready, the texture will change and a clear line should show when you run your spatula along the base of the pan. Pour the caramel over the oat base and smooth the surface. Leave to set at room temperature for 1 hr.
- Melt the dark chocolate in a heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering water, ensuring the bowl doesn’t touch the water. Or, do this in themicrowavein short bursts. Repeat this in a separate bowl to melt the white chocolate, if using. Pour the melted dark chocolate over the caramel layer, tilting the tin back and forth so the chocolate evenly covers the caramel. Drizzle over the white chocolate (if using), and use a skewer to swirl the two together to create a marbled effect. Leave to set at room temperature for 2-3 hrs for a soft-set chocolate layer, or chill for 1 hr if you prefer it to snap. Once set, lift the flapjacks from the tin using the baking parchment, and cut into squares.Will keep in an airtight container for up to four days.
