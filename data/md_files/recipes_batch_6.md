### Ingredients
- 1camembert(about 250g) in a wooden box (see tip, below)
- 50gpanko breadcrumbs
- 1 tspfresh thyme leaves
- 7fresh bay leaves, to serve (optional)
- cranberry sauceor chilli jam, to serve
- 600gstrong white bread flour, plus extra for dusting

- 3eggs, lightly beaten
- 200mlmilk, warmed
- 150gbutter, softened
- For the brioche buns
- 600gstrong white bread flour, plus extra for dusting
- 7g sachetfast-action dried yeast
- 2 tspgolden caster sugar
- 3eggs, lightly beaten
- 200mlmilk, warmed
- 150gbutter, softened

### Instructions
- First, make the brioche dough. Put the flour, yeast, sugar and 2 tsp salt into the bowl of astand mixerfitted with a dough hook. Pour 2 tbsp of the beaten egg into a small bowl and set aside. Tip the rest of the egg into the mixer bowl along with the warmed milk. Mix on a medium speed until the mixture comes together to form a dough, then carry on mixing for 5 mins on a medium speed, or until springy and glossy.
- With the machine still running, add the butter, a small piece at a time, until fully incorporated, about 8-10 mins. At first, it will look like it’s not coming together, but keep working the dough, scraping down the sides of the mixing bowl as you go. Once all the butter has been worked in, carry on mixing for a minute or two until smooth. Form into a ball and cover the bowl with a tea towel. Leave for about an hour until doubled in size.
- Tip the dough out onto a floured surface and knead to knock out the air, then divide into 24 equal pieces, roughly weighing 45g each, and roll each into a ball. Take the cheese out of the box, set aside and put the empty box in the middle of a largebaking traylined with baking parchment. Arrange a ring of 8-10 dough balls around the box, then another ring of balls around that one, fitting them into the gaps. Leave to prove in a warm place for 30 mins or chill for a few hours.
- Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Brush the dough balls with the reserved beaten egg, sprinkle with salt and use a pair ofscissorsto make a snip in the top of each one to give them a spiked effect. Unwrap the cheese and return to the wooden box. Sprinkle over the breadcrumbs and thyme leaves, and bake for 25-30 mins until the dough balls are golden brown. Leave to cool for 5 mins, then scatter over the bay leaves, if using, and serve with cranberry sauce or chilli jam.

- For the chocolate sauce
- 100mldouble cream
- 1 tbspchestnut syrupor liqueur (optional)
- 25gunsalted butter
- 100gdark chocolate, finely chopped or grated

### Instructions
- First, make the filling. Push the chestnut purée through asieveusing the back of a spoon into a bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer. Pour in the cream and vanilla, then sift in the icing sugar. Add the brandy or liqueur and beat using an electric whisk or in thestand mixerfor a few minutes until the mixture creates soft peaks. Chill until needed.
- Sift the flour and a pinch of salt into a bowl and set aside. Warm the butter and 225ml water in a saucepan over a low heat until the butter has melted and the mixture is simmering. Stir in the seasoned flour and beat using a wooden spoon until everything has come together into a smooth dough that pulls away from the side of the pan. Spread the mixture out over a plate to quickly cool until just warm. Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/ gas 6 and line two baking sheets with baking parchment.
- When the dough has cooled slightly, scrape it into a bowl and beat in the eggs one at a time using a wooden spoon or electric whisk. You may not need all the eggs to achieve the right consistency – the dough should be smooth, silky and slowly fall off the spoon in a ‘V’ shape. Spoon the dough into apiping bagand snip off the end so you have a 1cm opening, or simply use the spoon to scoop the pastry if you don’t have a piping bag.
- Pipe or scoop walnut-sized balls of dough over the two baking sheets, being sure to leave a good amount of space between each. (You should have about 20 in total.) Bake for 30-35 mins, turning the trays around after 20 mins, until the profiteroles are puffed up and crisp. To ensure they don’t become soggy, you can poke a hole into each profiterole using a skewer and return them to the oven for a few minutes. Leave to cool completely.
- For the sauce, warm the cream and syrup, if using, in a pan over a low heat or in a heatproof bowl in short bursts in themicrowaveuntil steaming. Add the butter and chocolate, stir a few times, then leave to melt for 10 mins. Stir the mixture until glossy, then set aside.
- Cut each cooled profiterole in half, then pipe the filling into the bottom halves until it comes slightly over the edge. Sandwich with the tops, then arrange the filled profiteroles on a cake stand or platter, stacking them on top of one another. Pour over the sauce. If it has cooled and thickened too much, warm it over a low heat or in short blasts in the microwave until it’s pourable again. Sprinkle over the chopped marron glacé.

- 1ox cheek, cut into chunks
- 2 tbspvegetable or sunflower oil
- 2carrots, roughly chopped
- 1onion, finely chopped
- 2celery sticks, finely chopped
- 2garlic cloves, crushed or finely grated
- 2 tbspplain flour

- 150gcheddar, grated
- For the mash topping
- 1kgpotatoes, chopped
- 75mlwhole milk
- 50gbutter
- freshly grated nutmeg
- 150gcheddar, grated

### Instructions
- Pat the ox cheek dry with a clean tea towel or kitchen paper, then season well. Heat 1 tbsp of the oil in a large pan over a medium heat and brown the ox cheek all over, around 6-8 mins. Remove from the pan, leaving any oil behind.
- Drizzle the remaining oil into the pan and turn the heat down to medium-low. Tip the carrots, onion and celery into the pan, stir and cook for 10-12 mins until softened but not golden. Stir in the garlic, cook for 1 min, then tip in the flour and tomato purée and cook for 1 min. Pour in the wine, cook for a few minutes to evaporate the alcohol, then add the stock, Worcestershire sauce, thyme and bay leaf. Put the ox cheek back into the pan, then cover and simmer for 3 hrs until tender. (You could also transfer everything to aslow cookerat this point and cook for 5 hrs on high or 7 hrs on low.)
- About 30 mins before the ox cheek has finished cooking, bring a large pan of salted water to the boil and cook the potatoes for 15-20 mins until tender.

With the mashed potato back in the pan, pour in the milk, add the butter, grate in a little nutmeg and stir until the butter has melted in the residual heat.
- Shred the ox cheek in its gravy using two forks so that it’s broken down a little – this will help ensure the potato sits evenly on top. Tip the ox cheek mixture into a freezable ovenproof dish, then spoon over the mash. Use a fork to drag ridges through the mash, then scatter over the cheese. Bake for for 30-40 mins until the topping is golden.To freeze the pie, leave to cool completely after adding the mash topping, then cover with foil. Will keep frozen for up to three months. Cook from frozen at 180C/160C fan/gas 4 for 1 hr–1 hr 15 mins until piping hot throughout.Serve with cooked greens, if you like.

- Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Oil a 23cm springform cake tin that’s at least 6cm deep and line the base with baking parchment. Put the egg whites in a large bowl with a pinch of salt, and beat using an electric whisk until foamy, about 3 mins. Slowly add 150g of the sugar, a spoonful at a time, whisking continuously until thick and glossy.
- Mix the egg yolks, remaining sugar and vanilla together in a second bowl for 2 mins, or until pale and foamy. Add the flour, baking powder, spices and milk, then fold together using aspatula.
- Add a large spoonful of the whipped egg whites to the cake batter, beat to loosen, then fold through the remaining egg whites using a large metal spoon (don’t over-mix, or you’ll knock out the air) until smooth. Pour this into the tin, smooth the surface and bake for 40-45 mins until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Combine the evaporated and condensed milks with 50ml of the double cream.
- Leave the cake to cool in the tin for 10-15 mins, then carefully invert onto a serving plate or cake stand and remove the parchment. (Be sure to use a plate or stand with a slight lip to catch the excess milk.) Leave to cool for another 10 mins.
- Poke holes over the cake with a skewer and, while it’s still warm, slowly pour roughly a quarter of the milk mixture over the top. Leave the cake to absorb this before adding more, then repeat until all of the milk mixture is used up – if the cake becomes saturated before you’ve used all the milk, pour what’s left into a jug and serve alongside the cake later for pouring over. This process could take a couple of hours, but as soon as the cake is cool, you should transfer it to the fridge. Once all of the milk has been absorbed, chill for another 2 hrs, or overnight, to chill and improve the texture.
- Whip the remaining cream and the 2 tbsp condensed milk to soft peaks. Spoon over the chilled cake, then dust with a pinch of cinnamon.Will keep chilled for two days.

### Instructions
- If you have time, prepare the dough the day before you want to bake – this will help develop the flavour. Warm the milk in a pan over a medium heat until just steaming (don’t let it boil), about 5 mins. Remove from the heat and add the treacle and butter, swirling the pan for 1-2 mins until the butter has melted and the milk has cooled slightly (it should be just warm).
- Tip the flour and spices into a large bowl, or the bowl of astand mixer. Add the yeast and 2 tbsp sugar to one side of the bowl, and ½ tsp salt to the other. Whisk together, then pour in the warm milk mixture. Mix using a wooden spoon or dough hook attachment until you have a soft dough (it should be a little sticky). Tip onto a lightly floured surface and knead by hand for 8-10 mins, or using the mixer for about 5 mins. Add another 1 tbsp flour if the dough is very sticky. It should feel stretchy and soft – you should be able to pull it without it breaking straightaway, which indicates the gluten has been developed. Lightly oil a bowl, tip in the dough, cover and leave to prove at room temperature for 2-3 hrs, or until doubled in size. Chill overnight if you can. (If the dough is being chilled, take it out of the fridge 30 mins before using.
- For the spiced butter, combine the butter, sugar, vanilla, spices and a pinch of salt until smooth, then stir in the stem ginger. Tip the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, shape into a rough rectangle, thenroll outto about 50 x 40cm. Spread the spiced butter over in an even layer all the way to the edges.
- Working from one of the longer sides, roll the dough up as tightly as you can into a log. Cut in half, then cut each half into three pieces, then halve each piece so you have 12 pieces in total. Line a large, round baking dish or cake tin (about 33cm) with baking parchment. Arrange the buns in the dish or tin cut-side up, leaving some space between each to expand. Cover loosely and leave for 30 mins-2 hrs (depending on how warm your kitchen is) until the buns have puffed up and are touching. Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6.
- Bake the buns for 25 mins until golden. If they still look a little doughy at the centre but the edges are dark, cover with foil and continue to bake until they are cooked through. Leave to cool slightly in the tin until just warm. Once cool, the buns will keep frozen for three months. Defrost overnight and warm in low oven before icing. Meanwhile, make the icing.
- Melt the butter in a saucepan over a medium heat, swirling the pan until the butter turns nut brown – watch closely to ensure it doesn’t burn. You should see the milk solids start to turn golden after 5-8 mins, and it will have a nutty aroma. Pour into a heatproof bowl and chill for 30 mins until softly set, or freeze for 15 mins, stirring every 5 mins. It should be a spreadable consistency.
- Beat the chilled brown butter, soft cheese, icing sugar and spices together until smooth. Spread the icing over the buns while they are still slightly warm, so the icing drips into the swirls without melting completely. Leave to set for 30 mins before serving.Will keep for up to three days in an airtight container.
