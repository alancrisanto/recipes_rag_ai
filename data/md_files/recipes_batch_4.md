- **saturates:** 4g
- **carbs:** 37g
- **sugars:** 22g
- **fibre:** 1g
- **protein:** 6g
- **salt:** 0.5g

### Ingredients
- 140mlvegetable oil, plus extra for the tin
- 6eggs, separated
- 200gcaster sugar
- 140mlcoconut milk(see tip, below)
- 1 tbsppandan extract
- 200gself-raising flour
- 1 tbspicing sugar, for dusting

### Instructions
- Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6 and oil the base of a 23cm chiffon cake tin. It’s important not to oil the sides, as the cake mixture will cling to them as it rises. This prevents the air bubbles collapsing, giving the cake its bouncy texture.Whiskthe egg yolks and half the caster sugar together in a large bowl with an electric whisk until the mixture becomes light and creamy, about 3 mins. Mix in the vegetable oil, coconut milk and the pandan extract, until combined.
- Clean the beaters, then beat the egg whites in a separate bowl until soft peaks form, about 3 mins. Gradually add the remaining caster sugar, a spoonful at a time, while beating until the egg whites are stiff and shiny, about 3 mins.
- Siftthe flour and ¼ tsp salt into the egg yolk mixture. Gently fold together using a large metal spoon until just combined, being careful not to overmix – you want to keep as much air in the batter as possible.
- Using the metal spoon, gently fold roughly a third of the beaten egg whites into the cake batter to loosen it. Fold in the remaining egg whites until no streaks remain, making sure you don’t overmix. Pour the batter into the prepared cake tin. Bake on the middle shelf for 30 mins, or until golden brown. Insert a skewer into the centre of the cake, if it comesout clean, the cake is cooked; if not, return to the oven for another 5 mins then check again.
- Remove the cake from the oven and immediately invert the tin onto acooling rack. Leave to cool completely in the tin upside-down. This helps prevent the cake from collapsing. Carefully remove it from the tin by running a knife around the edges. Transfer the cake to a serving plate and dust with icing sugar.Will keep in an airtight container for three days.

- 100ghoney
- 1 tbsporange juice
- For the honey syrup
- 100glight brown soft sugar
- 100ghoney
- 1 tbsporange juice

### Instructions
- Combine the flour, yeast, sugar and ½ tsp fine salt in a large bowl. Heat the milk and butter in a small pan over a low heat, swirling the pan regularly until beginning to steam. Pour into a bowl and set aside to cool to room temperature.
- Make a well in the dry ingredients, then pour in the milk and butter mixture. Swiftly combine using a spoon, then turn out on to a floured surface and knead the dough for 10 mins. Or, do this in astand mixerusing the dough hook for 7 mins. Transfer to a lightly oiled bowl, cover and leave in a warm place to double in size for at least 1 hr. Alternatively, for the best flavour, leave the dough to rise in the fridge overnight.
- For the filling, use a wooden spoon to beat together the butter, sugar and orange zest. Finely chop the walnuts and 100g of the pistachios – by hand or in afood processor. Mix into the butter mixture along with the cinnamon, allspice and ¼ tsp fine sea salt.
- Tip the dough onto a lightly floured surface, shape into a rough rectangle, then roll out until it’s about 45 x 35cm. Spread the cinnamon nut butter over the dough, all the way out to the edges. Working from one of the longer sides, roll the dough up as tightly as you can into a sausage shape. Cut into 12 equal pieces. (You can mark with a ruler at around 3.5-4cm per bun, then cut with a piece of dental floss, thread or sharp knife.) Line a large 20 x 30cmbaking trayor tin with baking parchment.
- Arrange the buns, cut-side up, in the tray. Make sure the tails of the buns (where the dough opens) are tucked in so they don’t unfurl when baked. Leave some space around each bun, as they will expand. Cover loosely and leave to rise for 30-45 mins (depending on how warm your kitchen is) until the buns are puffed up and touching at the sides. Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Bake for 30 mins, or until golden and risen.
- Meanwhile, make the syrup. Put the sugar and honey in a small pan, simmer for 5 mins, then remove from the heat. Leave to cool, then stir in the orange juice. Take the buns out of the oven, immediately pour over the syrup and leave to cool.
- Finely chopthe remaining pistachios and sprinkle over the buns in little mounds – just as is done on baklava. Serve warm.Will keep in an airtight container for three days.Warm briefly in the oven before eating.
