- For the naan
- 250ggluten-free self-raising flour
- 260gGreek yogurt(or any thick, plain yogurt)
- 1cauliflower, cut into florets
- 3 tbspvegetable oil
- 2 tspgaram masala
- For the roasted cauliflower
- 1cauliflower, cut into florets
- 3 tbspvegetable oil
- 2 tspgaram masala

### Instructions
- Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. To prepare the naan, put the flour, Greek yogurt (give it a good stir before using) and a pinch of salt in a largemixing bowl. Mix together using aspatulaand, as it starts to come together, use your hands to bring it together into a slightly sticky ball. Cover and set aside.
- To make the roasted cauliflower, tip the cauliflower onto a large baking tray, drizzle with the oil, then sprinkle with garam masala and a pinch of salt and pepper. Mix so the cauliflower is well coated and set aside.
- To make the dhal, place a large pan with a lid on a medium heat and add the oil. Tip in the leek and cook for a few minutes to soften. Mix in the ginger paste, chilli flakes, turmeric, curry powder and garam masala and cook for 1 min. Pour in the chopped tomatoes, coconut milk, stock and lentils, then stir in. Bring to a simmer and cook for 20 mins, stirring occasionally so it doesn’t stick.
- Meanwhile, put the cauliflower in the oven and roast for around 25-30 mins until softer and starting to colour, turning halfway.
- To make the naan, knead the dough on a well-floured surface briefly until it's smooth, combined and no longer sticky. Divide the dough into four equal portions. Using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll out a portion of dough into an oval 3mm thick. Heat a large frying pan over a high heat. The higher the heat, the more bubbles you’ll get in the naan. Once heated, carefully transfer the naan to the dry frying pan using a fish slice. Leave to cook on one side for 2 mins or until nicely browned, then flip and cook for 1 min. After flipping, press down firmly on the naan using a spatula – this encourages it to puff up a little. Repeat using the rest of the dough.
- Once the dhal is ready, the lentils will be tender. Stir through the spinach to wilt and season to taste. Top the dhal with roasted cauliflower and serve with a naan on the side.To freeze, freeze the dhal and naan separately. Reheat the dhal in the microwave and the naan in the oven.

- 1 tspvanilla bean paste
- 350mlwhole milk
- 100mldouble cream
- 70gsugar
- 3eggs
- 20gunsalted butter, melted and cooled
- 120gself-raising flour
- 15gmatcha powder, plus extra to serve
- vegetable oil, for frying
- For the crêpes
- 350mlwhole milk
- 100mldouble cream
- 70gsugar
- 3eggs
- 20gunsalted butter, melted and cooled
- 120gself-raising flour
- 15gmatcha powder, plus extra to serve
- vegetable oil, for frying

### Instructions
- For the cream, mix the gelatine powder with 20ml water and leave to stand at room temperature for 10 mins. Put in the fridge for a further 10 mins.
- Put the white chocolate in a heatproof bowl, then put 175g of the cream and the vanilla bean paste in a small saucepan over a medium heat and bring to a simmer. Remove from the heat and leave to cool for a minute. Stir the gelatine mixture into the hot cream until it melts.
- Pour the hot cream mixture over the chocolate and leave to melt for 1-2 mins, then stir until the mixture is thoroughly combined. Pour in the remaining 400ml cream and stir again to combine. Pour the cream mixture into a container and cover with compostable cling film or baking parchment, ensuring it's touching the surface. Chill for at least 4 hrs, or preferably overnight.
- To make the crêpes, warm the milk, cream and sugar in a small, deep pan over a low heat until the sugar has dissolved and is warm to the touch.
- Crack the eggs into a large bowl and gradually pour in the warm milk mixture, whisking continuously. Pour in the cooled melted butter and whisk together.
- Sieve half of the flour and matcha into the bowl with a pinch of salt, and whisk until smooth. Then, sieve over the rest and gently whisk until just combined. Don’t over-mix the batter. Cover and leave to rest in the fridge for 1 hr.
- To cook, heat a non-stick frying pan over a medium heat and brush with a thin coat of oil. Remove the batter from the fridge and stir gently before pouring a ladleful into the pan and swirling to coat evenly. Cook the crêpe for around 2 mins on each side until set and lightly browned. Repeat until you have used all the batter (you should get about eight 20cm crêpes and one larger crêpe). Set aside to cool.
- To assemble the cake, put the white chocolate Chantilly in a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment and whip to soft peaks. Alternatively, you can do this with an electric whisk, or by hand. Lay the large crêpe on compostable cling film or baking parchment – this will make it easier to move later.
- Spread 2-3 tbsp Chantilly cream in the centre of the first crêpe and use an offset spatula to spread and level it, leaving a 2.5cm border around the edge. Centre a smaller crêpe on top and spread over another 2-3 tbsp cream. Repeat this process to use up all the crêpes.
- Carefully lift the cake into a shallow pasta bowl. The bowl will shape the cake and allow the large crêpe to curve around the edges. Chill for 1 hr, or until the cream is just set.Will keep covered in the fridge for up to three days. Once ready to serve, turn out onto a board and dust with matcha powder.
