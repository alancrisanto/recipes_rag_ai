- ½garlic clove
- cornichons
- bitter leaf salad(see tip, below)
- To serve
- cornichons
- bitter leaf salad(see tip, below)

### Method
- Melt the butter in a large frying or cast iron pan over a medium heat and stir in the bacon lardons or pancetta. Fry for 5-8 mins until starting to crisp up and the fat has rendered. Season with ¼ tsp freshly ground black pepper and cook for about 1 min more to toast the pepper, then stir in the onions. Season with a pinch of salt, then continue to cook for another 5-8 mins until the onions are soft but not too deeply coloured.
- Meanwhile,peelthe potatoes and cut into slices slightly thicker than the width of a £1 coin. When the onions are ready, tip the potatoes into the pan and cook everything for 10 mins, tossing regularly until the potatoes are nearly cooked through and have a taken on a bit of colour.
- Carefully pour in the wine and bubble for 5 mins, still tossing the pan occasionally, until the wine has reduced completely and the potatoes are tender when pierced with the tip of a knife. Remove from the heat, spoon over the crème fraîche and grate over a small amount of nutmeg. Stir everything together so the potatoes are completely coated in the crème fraîche.
- Cut the cheese in half through the equator so you have two thinner rounds. Chop one of the rounds into small chunks, then stir these through the potato mixture. Sprinkle a little salt into a medium gratin dish, then rub the cut side of the garlic clove all over the inside of the dish. Discard the garlic. Scrape the potato mixture into the dish, then nestle the other cheese round, rind-side up, onto the top of the mixture.At this stage, the tartiflette will keep up to a day ahead. Cover and chill until needed, then remove from the fridge 1 hr before cooking.
- Heat the oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 8. Bake the tartiflette for 20-25 mins until the cheese is oozing and golden, and the mixture is bubbling at the edge. Leave to stand for 5 mins, then serve with cornichons and a bitter leaf salad.

- **salt:** 0.82g

### Ingredients
- 250ggluten-free self-raising flour
- ½ tsp finesalt
- 1 tspxanthan gum
- 1 tspgluten-free baking powder
- 50gcaster sugar
- 40gcold butter, cubed
- 75mlwhole milk
- 1large eggand 1 egg yolk
- 50gsultanas(optional)

### Method
- Mix the flour, salt, xanthan gum, baking powder and sugar together in a bowl. Rub in the butter with your fingertips until you have fine breadcrumbs. You can also do this by gradually pulsing the mixture in afood processoruntil it resembles breadcrumbs.
- Whisk together the milk and whole egg and gradually mix into the flour mixture with your hands until you have a smooth dough. Mix in the sultanas, if using. Knead briefly to come together into a ball.
- Gently roll out the scone dough until 2cm thick. Transfer to abaking traylined with parchment and chill for 30 mins to firm up the dough – this makes them easier to cut out.
- Remove the dough from the fridge and, using a 5cm cutter, cut out 6-8 scones (press the offcuts together and re-roll when you need to). Put the scones upside down (this will mean you get a neater top when baked) onto another baking tray lined with baking parchment, spread 2cm apart.
- Whisk the egg yolk and evenly brush the tops of the scones, making sure that the egg wash doesn’t run down the sides of the scones otherwise they will rise unevenly. Put the scones on a tray and transfer to the freezer for 15 mins. Heat oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Remove the scones from the freezer and brush the tops with the beaten egg again, then bake for 12-15 mins until golden brown. Eat just warm or cold, generously topped with jam and cream, if you like.
