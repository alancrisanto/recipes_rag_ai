### Method
- Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Line 2 baking trays with baking parchment. Melt the butter, sugar and syrup in a small saucepan. Mix in the vanilla, remove from the heat and leave to cool for 10 mins.
- Sieve the flour and bicarbonate of soda into a bowl. Pour in the melted butter mixture and the egg, and stir together to form a stiff-ish dough. Pop the dough in the fridge for 10 mins to chill and firm up.
- Roll the dough out on a floured surface to 5mm thick, then stamp out 15 circles using a 7.5cm round cookie cutter; you may need to re-roll the trimmings to get 15 cookies. Make a hole at the top of each circle with the end of a pencil.
- Place on the baking trays and bake for 12 mins until golden, swapping the trays around halfway through. Cool on a wire rack.
- To decorate, divide the icing into 4 pieces. Dye 3 lumps of icing with your chosen base colours (we used turquoise, coral and yellow).
- Roll out the coloured icing to 2mm thick, then use a fluted 7cm cutter to cut out 15 rounds.
- Stick these onto the cookies with a little icing sugar mixed with water.
- Roll out the remaining icing, brush it with a little water and cut out 12 stars. Dip each star, sticky-side down, into a dish of edible gold glitter, then stick them on top of the cookies.
- Use number cutters to stamp out numbers 1, 2 and 3, dip these into the glitter and stick to the final 3 medals. Using icing pens to add a border, if you like.
- Leave the cookies to dry, then push a hole through the icing in line with the cookie hole and tie up with ribbon.Will keep for three days in an airtight container.

**Serves:** Serves 6

**Diet Type:** Gluten-free

- **saturates:** 18g
- **carbs:** 13g
- **sugars:** 12g
- **fibre:** 6g
- **protein:** 31g
- **salt:** 1.1g

### Ingredients
- 100mlolive oil
- 500glamb mince
- 1onion, finely chopped
- 3 largegarlic cloves, crushed
- ½ tsplight brown soft sugar
- 2 tbsptomato purée
- 2 tbspred wine vinegar
- 400g canchopped tomatoes
- 200mlred wine
- 1 tbspdried oregano
- 1cinnamon stick
- 2bay leaves
- 3aubergines
- mixed salad leaves, to serve
- 500mlGreek yogurt
- 1egg, plus 1 yolk, lightly beaten (freeze the white for another recipe)
- 50gparmesan, grated
- pinch ofgrated nutmeg
- 100gfeta, crumbled
- For the topping
- 500mlGreek yogurt
- 1egg, plus 1 yolk, lightly beaten (freeze the white for another recipe)
- 50gparmesan, grated
- pinch ofgrated nutmeg
- 100gfeta, crumbled

### Method
- Heat 2 tbsp of the olive oil in a pan over a medium-low heat, crumble in the mince and cook for 15-20 mins. Itwill release some liquid but once that has bubbled away, the mince will sizzle in its own fat and start to brown and caramelise. At this point, stir the mince with a wooden spoon.
- Stir in the onion and continue to cook for 10 mins until it’s softened. Add the garlic and cook for a minute more. Scatter the sugar over, then stir through the tomato purée and cook until it’s toasted and starts to stick to the pan. Splash in the vinegar and let it simmer for a minute. Tip in the canned tomatoes, then use the wine to swill out the can and tip into the sauce. Season with salt and pepper, scatter in the oregano, nestle in the cinnamon stick and bay leaves, bring to a simmer and cook gently, stirring occasionally, for 40 mins until you have a thick ragu. Remove from the heat, fish out the bay and cinnamon, and stir through another 1 tbsp of the olive oil.
- While the ragu is cooking, cut the tops off the aubergines, then cut lengthways into 1cm thick slices. Put in a bowl and lightly salt, and set aside for 20 mins until they soften and become droopy. Drizzle liberally with the rest of the olive oil and toss well. Heat a griddle pan over a high heat and cook the slices on both sides for a few minutes until soft and lightly charred. You’ll need to do this in batches. Leave to cool slightly on a plate. (This can also be done on abarbecueif you have time.)
- For the topping, tip the yogurt into a bowl with the whole egg and yolk, half the parmesan, the nutmeg and some salt and pepper, thenwhiskuntil combined. Spoon a third of the meat into a large rectangular ovenproof dish (ours was roughly 20 x 30cm) and spread out evenly, lay half the aubergine on top, then another third of the meat sauce followed by the remaining slices of aubergine. Pour in the last of the lamb sauce, then spoon over the yogurt mix smoothing it to the edges. Scatter the feta over along with the rest of the parmesan.Will keep chilled for two days.
- Heat the oven to 200C/180 fan/gas 4. Bake the moussaka for 50 mins or until deep golden brown. Set aside for at least 10 mins to cool before serving with a side salad, if you like.

### Ingredients
- 2eggs, separated (you will have 1 yolk leftover, which can be frozen to use in another recipe)
- 25gnatural full-fat yogurt
- 70gwhole milk
- 70gplain flour
- ¼ tspvanilla extract
- 13gunsalted butter
- 25gcaster sugar
- vegetable oil or spray oil, for frying
- butter, maple syrup, honey, berries or whipped cream, to serve (optional)

### Method
- Put the two egg whites into a small bowl and freeze for 10 mins until just starting to freeze at the edges.
- Meanwhile, put one of the egg yolks in a medium bowl with the yogurt and milk, and mix well.Siftin the flour and whisk it in, followed by the vanilla – it should resemble a runny custard. Fill a larger bowl with ice, then sit the medium bowl on top to keep the batter cold.
- Melt the butter in a pan over a low heat and, as soon as it's liquid, pour the butter into the flour mixture,whiskinglightly until just combined. Remove the egg whites from the freezer, put in a stand mixer and whisk briefly. Gradually add the sugar, and continue to whisk for 3 mins until you have a fluffy meringue. Spoon the meringue into the flour mixture, and gently fold in using a large metal spoon orspatulauntil fully incorporated, being careful not to over-mix.
- Heat a drizzle of oil (or mist with spray oil) in a large lidded frying pan over a low-medium heat and wipe out the excess using kitchen paper. The pan needs to be hot enough to cook the pancakes, but not so hot that it burns the outside without cooking the centre. Spoon the batter into apiping bagwith the tip cut off (you want about a 1.5cm hole). Pipe a circle into the hot frying pan, then pipe concentric circles on top of the first, until the pancake is about 5-8cm high. Cover with the lid and cook for 3 mins, then carefully flip over and cook for another 3 mins. Repeat with the remaining batter.
- Divide the cooked pancakes between plates and serve with your favourite toppings.
