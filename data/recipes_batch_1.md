\#\#\# Ingredients
\- 140gbutter
\- 100glight soft brown sugar
\- 3 tbspgolden syrup
\- ½ tspvanilla extract
\- 350gplain flour, plus extra for dusting
\- 1 tspbicarbonate of soda
\- 1large egg
\- 1kgpack ready\-to\-roll icing
\- icing sugar
\- food colouringpaste, edible glitter and icing pens (optional)
\- 15long colourful ribbons
\- To decorate
\- 1kgpack ready\-to\-roll icing
\- icing sugar
\- food colouringpaste, edible glitter and icing pens (optional)
\- 15long colourful ribbons

\#\#\# Method
1\. Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6\. Line 2 baking trays with baking parchment. Melt the butter, sugar and syrup in a small saucepan. Mix in the vanilla, remove from the heat and leave to cool for 10 mins.
1\. Sieve the flour and bicarbonate of soda into a bowl. Pour in the melted butter mixture and the egg, and stir together to form a stiff\-ish dough. Pop the dough in the fridge for 10 mins to chill and firm up.
1\. Roll the dough out on a floured surface to 5mm thick, then stamp out 15 circles using a 7\.5cm round cookie cutter; you may need to re\-roll the trimmings to get 15 cookies. Make a hole at the top of each circle with the end of a pencil.
1\. Place on the baking trays and bake for 12 mins until golden, swapping the trays around halfway through. Cool on a wire rack.
1\. To decorate, divide the icing into 4 pieces. Dye 3 lumps of icing with your chosen base colours (we used turquoise, coral and yellow).
1\. Roll out the coloured icing to 2mm thick, then use a fluted 7cm cutter to cut out 15 rounds.
1\. Stick these onto the cookies with a little icing sugar mixed with water.
1\. Roll out the remaining icing, brush it with a little water and cut out 12 stars. Dip each star, sticky\-side down, into a dish of edible gold glitter, then stick them on top of the cookies.
1\. Use number cutters to stamp out numbers 1, 2 and 3, dip these into the glitter and stick to the final 3 medals. Using icing pens to add a border, if you like.
1\. Leave the cookies to dry, then push a hole through the icing in line with the cookie hole and tie up with ribbon.Will keep for three days in an airtight container.

\#\#\# Ingredients
\- 100mlolive oil
\- 500glamb mince
\- 1onion, finely chopped
\- 3 largegarlic cloves, crushed
\- ½ tsplight brown soft sugar
\- 2 tbsptomato purée
\- 2 tbspred wine vinegar
\- 400g canchopped tomatoes
\- 200mlred wine
\- 1 tbspdried oregano
\- 1cinnamon stick
\- 2bay leaves
\- 3aubergines
\- mixed salad leaves, to serve
\- 500mlGreek yogurt
\- 1egg, plus 1 yolk, lightly beaten (freeze the white for another recipe)
\- 50gparmesan, grated
\- pinch ofgrated nutmeg
\- 100gfeta, crumbled
\- For the topping
\- 500mlGreek yogurt
\- 1egg, plus 1 yolk, lightly beaten (freeze the white for another recipe)
\- 50gparmesan, grated
\- pinch ofgrated nutmeg
\- 100gfeta, crumbled

\#\#\# Method
1\. Heat 2 tbsp of the olive oil in a pan over a medium\-low heat, crumble in the mince and cook for 15\-20 mins. Itwill release some liquid but once that has bubbled away, the mince will sizzle in its own fat and start to brown and caramelise. At this point, stir the mince with a wooden spoon.
1\. Stir in the onion and continue to cook for 10 mins until it’s softened. Add the garlic and cook for a minute more. Scatter the sugar over, then stir through the tomato purée and cook until it’s toasted and starts to stick to the pan. Splash in the vinegar and let it simmer for a minute. Tip in the canned tomatoes, then use the wine to swill out the can and tip into the sauce. Season with salt and pepper, scatter in the oregano, nestle in the cinnamon stick and bay leaves, bring to a simmer and cook gently, stirring occasionally, for 40 mins until you have a thick ragu. Remove from the heat, fish out the bay and cinnamon, and stir through another 1 tbsp of the olive oil.
1\. While the ragu is cooking, cut the tops off the aubergines, then cut lengthways into 1cm thick slices. Put in a bowl and lightly salt, and set aside for 20 mins until they soften and become droopy. Drizzle liberally with the rest of the olive oil and toss well. Heat a griddle pan over a high heat and cook the slices on both sides for a few minutes until soft and lightly charred. You’ll need to do this in batches. Leave to cool slightly on a plate. (This can also be done on abarbecueif you have time.)
1\. For the topping, tip the yogurt into a bowl with the whole egg and yolk, half the parmesan, the nutmeg and some salt and pepper, thenwhiskuntil combined. Spoon a third of the meat into a large rectangular ovenproof dish (ours was roughly 20 x 30cm) and spread out evenly, lay half the aubergine on top, then another third of the meat sauce followed by the remaining slices of aubergine. Pour in the last of the lamb sauce, then spoon over the yogurt mix smoothing it to the edges. Scatter the feta over along with the rest of the parmesan.Will keep chilled for two days.
1\. Heat the oven to 200C/180 fan/gas 4\. Bake the moussaka for 50 mins or until deep golden brown. Set aside for at least 10 mins to cool before serving with a side salad, if you like.
