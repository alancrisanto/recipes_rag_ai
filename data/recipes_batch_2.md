### Ingredients
- 250gplain flour,plus a little for dusting
- 50gcold butter,diced
- 50glard(or use butter if you prefer)
- 4 tbspmilk,plus a splash
- Or 250g block of ready-madeshortcrust pastry
- 125mlmilk
- 175mldouble cream
- 2 mediumeggs
- 1 tbspchopped fresh tarragon
- 100gcheddar,grated
- 180g cookedspinach,liquid squeezed out and lightly chopped
- 60g cookedbroad beansor soya beans (double pod the broad beans, if you like)
- For the filling
- 125mlmilk
- 175mldouble cream
- 2 mediumeggs
- 1 tbspchopped fresh tarragon
- 100gcheddar,grated
- 180g cookedspinach,liquid squeezed out and lightly chopped
- 60g cookedbroad beansor soya beans (double pod the broad beans, if you like)

### Method
- Sieve the flour into a bowl with ½ tsp salt. Add the butter and lard, and rub the mixture together using your fingertips until you get a sandy, breadcrumb-like texture. Add the milk, a little at a time, and using a cutlery knife, start to bring the dough together, using your hands, making sure it has no dry patches and feels smooth. Cover and allow to rest in the fridge for 30-45 mins.
- Put a 20cm loose-bottomed tart tin or a 20cm pastry ring on a baking sheet. Lightly flour the work surface and roll out the pastry to a circle a little larger than the top of the tin and approximately 5mm thick. Carefully lift the pastry into the tin and gently press into the corners, taking care not to have any holes or the mixture could leak. Cover and rest for a further 30 mins in the fridge. Heat oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5.
- Line the pastry case with greaseproof paper – to do this cut a disc of greaseproof paper larger than the tin, scrunch it into a ball (this makes it more pliable), then unwrap and place it in the pastry case. It should come above the sides. Fill with baking beans or uncooked rice and bake blind for 20-25 until nicely golden and dry. Carefully remove the greaseproof paper and baking beans, and return to the oven for 5 mins to dry the base. Reduce the oven temperature to 160C/140C fan/gas 3.
- Beat the milk, cream, eggs and herbs with some seasoning. Scatter half of the grated cheese in the blind-baked base, top with the chopped spinach and beans, then pour over the liquid mixture. If required, gently give the mixture a delicate stir to ensure the filling is evenly dispersed, but be careful not to damage the pastry case. Sprinkle over the remaining cheese. Place into the oven and bake for 20-30 mins until set and very lightly golden.

- 2 tbspmilk
- 2 tspvanilla extract
- 300gstrawberry or raspberry jam
- 500gwhite fondant
- a few drops of pink food colouring gel

### Method
- Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Line two 20cm square tins with baking parchment. Beat the butter and sugar together in a large bowl using an electric whisk for 2-3 mins until smooth and creamy. Crack in the eggs, one at a time, adding a spoonful of the flour between each addition and whisking continuously. When all the eggs are incorporated, tip in the remaining flour and fold it in. Pour in the milk and vanilla and mix well, making sure there are no pockets of flour.
- Divide the batter between the tins, smooth the surfaces and bake for 40 mins until risen, golden and a skewer inserted into the middles comes out clean. If any wet batter clings to the skewer, bake for 5 mins more, then check again. Once baked, cool in the tins for 20 mins, then transfer to awire rackto cool completely.Once cooled, the sponges will keep wrapped in the freezer for three months.
- For the buttercream, beat the butter, 500g icing sugar, the milk and vanilla in a bowl using an electric whisk until smooth and creamy. Cut out a roughly 14cm circle of baking parchment, scrunch it up and use it to line a 12cm bowl. Spoon half the buttercream into the bowl, gently pushing it down and smoothing the surface. Cover and freeze for 15 mins to firm up.
- Cut the sponges in half through the equator using a long, serrated knife to create four layers. Put one on a plate or cake stand, spread over a quarter of the remaining buttercream, spoon over a third of the jam and sandwich with a second layer of sponge. Repeat with the rest of the sponge layers, using most of the remaining buttercream and the rest of the jam. Spread the last of the buttercream over the top and sides of the cake (don’t worry if it isn’t neat).
- Dust a surface with icing sugar and tip the fondant out. Add a few drops of the food colouring, kneading it in with your hands until the fondant is evenly pink. Roll it out into a roughly 60 x 60cm square.
- Invert the frozen buttercream dome on top of the cake and remove the parchment. Carefully lift the fondant over the cake, using your hands to smooth it over the dome and down the sides. Use a sharp knife to trim any excess fondant.
- Mix the 3 tbsp icing sugar with enough water to make a thick, drizzly icing. Spoon into apiping bag, snip off the tip and drizzle it back and forth over the cake, then leave to dry for a few minutes.Will keep in an airtight container for three days.
