(You can also do this in a bowl by rubbing everything together using your fingertips.) Mix in the egg yolk and a splash of cold water, if needed,to bring the mixture into a dough.

Put a couple of spoonfuls of the filling over each pastry circle, just off-centre, then brush the beaten egg around the filling and fold the pastry over so the edges meet. Crimp the edges or seal with a fork. Put on a baking tray, cut a few small slashes into the top of each pasty, brush over the remaining beaten egg and bake for 20-25 mins until crisp and golden brown.

      "For the papdi, put both the flours, semolina, carom seeds, cumin seeds and 1 tsp salt in amixing bowl. Gently mix the dry ingredients with your fingers, then mix in the ghee until you have a breadcrumb-like texture. Gradually mix in up to 10 tbsp lukewarm water, 2 tbsp at a time, until you form a dough and there are no bits left on the sides of the bowl. Turn out onto a clean work surface and knead a few times to form a soft dough. Put the dough back in the bowl and cover with a damp tea towel. Rest for 1 hr.",
      "Divide the dough into six equal balls. Flatten with the palm of your hand, then put on a lightly floured work surface. Roll out into a circle approximately 2mm in thickness. Using a 5cm cookie cutter, cut out as many circles as possible. Put each on a floured work surface to stop it from sticking. Repeat with the other five balls of dough. Once all the papdis have been cut out, take a fork and gently prick them about three times. This stops the papdi from puffing up.",
      "Half-fill a wok or karai with veg oil and heat until one papdi dropped in bubbles and rises to the top. Gently lower a few more into the oil, taking care not to add too many at once. Try to fry them as horizontally as possible to get flat papdis. Cook for a few minutes until golden. They can also be baked: put on baking sheet lined with baking parchment and cook in the oven at 180C/160C fan/gas 4 for 25 mins, turning halfway through, until golden. Once the papdis have been cooked, leave to cool to room temperature.",

Take off the heat and leave to cool for a few minutes, then tip into ablenderwith the coriander, mint, garlic, lemon juice, 1½ tsp salt, the sugar, chillies and 3 tbsp water. Blitz to a thick paste. Check for seasoning and add more salt and pepper, if necessary.",
      "To assemble the papdi chaat, put the following topping ingredients into a bowl: chickpeas, potatoes, chaat masala, chopped chilli, black salt and oil.

      "On a large serving dish or plate, lay out the papdi quite close to each other to cover the base of the dish. Generously add the chickpea and potato mixture on top of the papdis. Drizzle over the tamarind sauce and repeat with the raita. With a teaspoon, add half spoonfuls of the green chutney around the topping. Sprinkle over the pomegranate seeds, onions and coriander over.

      "For the filling, toast the cumin seeds, 1 tsp of the fennel seeds and coriander seeds in a small dry frying pan for 3-4 mins. Leave to cool, then in a coffee orspice grinder, grind the whole spices to a fine powder and set aside.",
      "Put the soaked and drained lentils, the slit green chilli and 8 tbsp of water in a small food processor. Blitz the lentils in short bursts to make a coarse paste. Some of the lentils can stay whole to give texture.",
      "Heat the rapeseed oil and ghee in a frying pan over a medium heat. Add the remaining 1 tsp fennel seeds and cook for 1 min to allow the aroma to release. Stir in the gram flour – it needs to be roasted to get rid of the raw smell. Cook on a low heat for 5 mins, stirring constantly to ensure it doesn’t burn. Stir in the lentil mixture and mix well to ensure there are no lumps. Tip in the ginger, chopped green chilli, turmeric, asafoetida, 1½ tsp salt, the sugar, 1 tsp of the spice powder you prepared earlier and the garam masala. Mix well and cook for 2-3 mins until the water has evaporated. The lentil filling should be dry and thick. Take off heat and allow to cool.",
      "To make the kachori, divide the rested dough into 10 equal portions and roll each one into a ball. Take a ball of dough and flatten with both palms into a flat circle, then by pressing your thumb against the ends, to make it thinner and larger in size. Put in the cup of your palm, so the dough takes that shape and fill with 1 tbsp of cooled filling.",
      "Bring the sides of the dough to the centre and pinch the ends to seal (try not to pinch too much of the dough together or that end will be too doughy). Repeat the process for 10 portions.",
      "Heat awokor karai half-filled with oil over a high heat and bring to 180C or until a piece of the dough dropped in sizzles immediately. Carefully lower in a few of the kachori and continue to cook in batches for 4 mins each time until browned. Remove using a slotted spoon and put on a plate lined with kitchen paper to drain. Serve immediately with your choice of sauces or chutney (we usedcoriander relish) and hot masala tea, if you like."

It should roll easily into a ball without sticking. If it does stick, continue heating the mixture over a gentle heat for a few more minutes. While the dough is still warm but not too hot to handle, spread out on the tray and allow to cook for around 15 mins.",
      "Rub a little ghee into your hand, then knead the dough gently (it will feel like soft fudge) for 1 min and then carefully begin to flatten it with your fingers to form a small circle. Put a few drops of ghee over the flattened dough. With a rolling pin, gently roll out the dough into a rough square to a thickness of about 1 cm.",
