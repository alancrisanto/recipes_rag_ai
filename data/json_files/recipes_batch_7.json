Meanwhile,roll outa piece of black fondant to 6cm in diameter and cut into two semi-circles.",
      "Cover the entire cake with buttercream, using a palette knife to smooth it over the surface and cover any gaps. Don’t worry about being too neat, as any imperfections will be covered. Press one of the black semi-circles of fondant onto the front of the small cake to mark out the entrance of the igloo. Press the coconut all over the rest of the cake.",
      "Use 100g of the white fondant to make snowballs in various sizes and arrange them around the base.",
      "To make the penguins, divide the remaining black fondant icing into four pieces of different sizes. Roll each piece into an egg shape, and pinch out little flippers on each side. Press out a disc of white fondant for each penguin’s belly, and attach with a dab of water. Make eyes by sticking little black spots onto small white discs of fondant and attach to the penguins. Finally, make orange triangle beaks and flippers and stick these on. Put the penguin family around the cake.Will keep in an airtight tin for up to five days."
