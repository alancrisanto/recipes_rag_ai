      "When the buns have cooled completely, pour the cream and vanilla into a large bowl. Whisk until the cream just holds soft peaks, then stir through most of the raspberries, mashing some lightly to create ripples. Using a serrated knife to cut down the middle of the buns, from the top and stopping around 2cm from the base. Spoon the cream into apiping bag, if you have one, and fill the buns with it, or use the spoon. (If using a piping bag, snip a hole in the end that’s large enough for the raspberries to come through.) While doing this, open the buns slightly, being careful not to break the base. Use the flat side of a cutlery knife or an offset spatula to scrape away any excess cream and achieve a smooth finish. Dip the maritozzi in the chopped hazelnuts and tear over the remaining raspberries. Dust with icing sugar to serve, if you like.Best served on the day of making but will keep in the fridge for to to two days."

      "Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Sit four 175ml ramekins in a deeproasting tinat least 7.5cm deep (or a large deep cake tin), one that will enable abaking trayto sit well above the ramekins when laid across the top of the tin.",
      "Pour the large and small cartons of double cream into a mediumpanwith the milk.",
      "Lay the vanilla pod on a board and slice lengthways through the middle with asharp knifeto split it in two. Use the tip of the knife to scrape out all the tiny seeds into the cream mixture. Drop the vanilla pod in as well, and set aside.",
      "Put the egg yolks and sugar in amixing bowland whisk for 1 min with anelectric hand whiskuntil paler in colour and a bit fluffy.",
      "Put the pan with the cream on a medium heat and bring almost to the boil. As soon as you see bubbles appear round the edge, take the pan off the heat.",
      "Pour the hot cream into the beaten egg yolks, stirring with a wire whisk as you do so, and scraping out the seeds from the pan.",
      "Set a fine sieve over a large wide jug or bowl and pour the hot mixture through to strain it, encouraging any stray vanilla seeds through at the end.",
      "Using a big spoon, scoop off all the pale foam that is sitting on the top of the liquid (this will be several spoonfuls) and discard. Give the mixture a stir.",
      "Pour in enough hot water (from the tap) into the roasting tin to come about 1.5cm up the sides of the ramekins. Pour the hot cream into the ramekins so you fill them up right to the top – it’s easier to spoon in the last little bit.",
      "Put them in the oven and lay a baking sheet over the top of the tin so it sits well above the ramekins and completely covers them, but not the whole tin, leaving a small gap at one side to allow air to circulate.",
      "Bake for 30-35 mins until the mixture is softly set. To check, gently sway the roasting tin and if the crème brûlées are ready, they will wobble a bit like a jelly in the middle. Don’t let them get too firm.",
      "Lift the ramekins out of the roasting tin with oven gloves and set them on awire rackto cool for a couple of minutes only, then put in the fridge to cool completely. This can be done overnight without affecting the texture.",
      "When ready to serve, wipe round the top edge of the dishes, sprinkle 1½ tsp of caster sugar over each ramekin and spread it out with the back of a spoon to completely cover.",
      "Spray with a little water using a fine spray (the sort you buy in a craft shop) to just dampen the sugar – then use a blow torch to caramelise it. Hold the flame just above the sugar and keep moving it round and round until caramelised. Serve when the brûlée is firm, or within an hour or two."

    "methods": [
      "For the noodles, use a spoon to combine the flour with 130ml water and a pinch of salt in a mixing bowl until it forms a rough dough. Knead for 5-10 mins until smooth. Cover and leave to rest for 30 mins.",
      "Meanwhile, combine the 1 tsp vegetable oil and the cornflour in a large bowl with a pinch of salt and ¼ tsp freshly ground black pepper. Tip in the lamb and massage into the meat. Leave to marinate while you make the noodles.",
      "Roll the noodle dough into a flat, round shape, then cut into 1cm strips. Brush vegetable oil over each strip before shaping into a 10cm-long rope; you can do this by rolling it with your fingers against the worktop, moving it outwards to help it stretch. Put each rope on an oiled plate so they spiral out from the centre, with one end touching the other. Leave to rest for another 20 mins.",
      "Bring a pan of water to the boil over a medium-high heat. Taking one rope of dough at a time, pull from each end until it stretches to a 0.3cm-thin string, about 35cm in length. Add to the boiling water, then repeat with the rest of the dough. Drain the noodles, reserving the water, and set both aside.",
      "Heat a large pan over a medium heat and cook the lamb for around 5-6 mins until all the pieces are brown. Remove from the pan and set aside.",
      "Using the same pan, heat the remaining 2 tbsp oil, add the onion and cook for around 2 mins to soften slightly before adding the garlic and cooking for another minute. Add the tomatoes, mushrooms, red pepper, cumin, tomato purée and a good pinch of salt. Cook for for 5-8 mins until the red peppers have softened.",
      "Add 4 tbsp water reserved from cooking the noodles, mix well and bring to the boil. Cook for 30 seconds-1 min until thickened. Remove from the heat. Divide the noodles between bowls, then pour the lamb stew on top."
