      "While the potatoes are cooking, heat a large frying pan or griddle and cook half the tofu steaks for 10 mins, turning frequently, until lightly golden. Halve two tomatoes and add to the pan, cut-side down, for the last 1-2 mins of cooking, or leave them uncooked if you prefer.",
      "To make the mushy peas, bring a medium pan of water to the boil and cook the peas for 5 mins until tender, then drain, reserving the water. Tip the peas back into the pan with the coriander, spring onions and 6-8 tbsp of the cooking water, and blitz using a hand blender to make a smooth purée. Pile half the chips onto two plates and serve with the tofu steaks, half the mushy peas and cooked tomatoes. Cover and chill the rest for another day.Will keep chilled for three days. Reheat the chips in a hot oven, cook the remaining tofu and tomatoes as described in step 3, and reheat the mushy peas in the microwave."

      "Stir in the penne, courgettes, three-quarters of the basil and the bouillon powder. Bring back to the boil, then cover and cook for 15 mins until the pasta is tender. Keep an eye on it, as you might need to add a little extra water if the pan becomes too dry.",

Remove the pasta mixture from the heat and level the surface using the back of a spoon or spatula. Pour the cashew sauce over the top, then scatter over the cherry tomatoes.

Leave the rest to cool completely, then chill for another day.Will keep chilled for up to four days. Reheat on plates in the microwave until piping hot and serve with the remaining rocket."
