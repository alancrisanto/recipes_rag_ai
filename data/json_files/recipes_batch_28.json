Lightly brush the edges of the chicken with some of the beaten egg, then lay a piece of butter in the centre. Fold one end of the chicken up over the butter and roll tightly to enclose. Secure the ends and middle using cocktail sticks.",
      "Pour the milk into a shallow dish and season. Tip the flour and paprika into a second dish, stir to combine, then pour the remaining beaten egg into a third and the breadcrumbs into a fourth. Coat the kievs in the milk, then the flour, egg and finally the breadcrumbs, turning to ensure they’re fully coated. Set aside on a plate and chill for 1 hr to ensure the butter stays firm, or until needed.Will keep chilled for a day.",

Fry the kievs for about 10 mins, turning with a slotted spoon until golden and crisp. Drain on kitchen paper, then transfer to abaking trayand cook in the oven for 8-10 mins until cooked through. Remove the cocktail sticks and serve."
