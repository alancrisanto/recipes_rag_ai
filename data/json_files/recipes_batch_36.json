Sift the flour with baking powder and a pinch of salt through a fine sieve to remove any lumps into a separate bowl. Crack the eggs into the butter mixture one at a time, beating well after each addition. If the mixture begins to curdle slightly, add a tablespoon or two of flour to bring it back together again, then mix in the vanilla, lemon zest, flour, and milk with a spatula. Spoon into the prepared tins and smooth out the surface. Bake for 25-30 mins until golden and a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Remove and leave to cool in the tins for 20-30 mins, then transfer to a wire rack to cool fully.",
      "To make the buttercream, beat the butter until light and fluffy. Beat in the icing sugar, bit by bit, then finally beat in the vanilla and milk if the icing needs a little loosening. Put your buttercream in a piping bag and snip a 2cm hole in the end. Put one of the cakes on a cake stand or plate. Spread the top with half the jam, leaving a 1cm border around the edge, then pipe on some of the buttercream around the border. Top with the second sponge and repeat the process. Cover with the third sponge and cover the top and sides thinly with the buttercream in a crumb coat. Put in the fridge for 1 hr to set. Spread with the rest of the buttercream, ensuring the surface is smooth. Return to the fridge to set for another 30 mins.",
      "To make the drizzle, put the dark chocolate in a bowl and heat the cream in a small pan until just steaming, not boiling. Pour the cream over the chocolate and leave to melt for a couple of minutes. If the ganache looks too thick or like it has split, simply add 1 tbsp whole milk and stir to make a glossy ganache, then set aside to cool a little. You want the ganache to be pourable but not too hot, as it will melt your buttercream.",
      "Pour it over the cooled cake in the centre then, using a small spatula, spread it out in a circular motion, making sure the top is covered and it drips down the sides. You need to work quickly here so your ganache doesn’t set before it drips. Scatter the chocolate eggs over the top. Leave to set for at least 15 mins. To cut into slices, dip the knife into hot water and wipe it before slicing."

Spread the chilli jam or chutney on the bottom slice, then sprinkle over the cheddar and add a slice of ham. Top with the other half of bagel and cook for 5 mins in the air-fryer to melt the cheese a little.",

If the egg seems a little too large, you can try lifting up the bagel slice just a little to allow some of the white to sit underneath. Put in the air-fryer and bake for 8-10 mins until the egg is cooked to your liking, the cheese has melted and the bagel is golden. Grind over a little black pepper, if you like."
