Combine the oil, vanilla and eggs in another bowl or jug, then mix into the dry ingredients. Fold in most of the chopped pecans (reserving some to decorate with later), the carrots and raisins, then pour into your prepared cake tin. Bake in the air-fryer for 25-45 mins depending on which cake tin you’ve used (25 mins for the round cake tin), checking after 15 mins. If the top begins to brown too much, cover the cake with foil.",
      "To check the cake is ready, insert a skewer into the centre – it should come out clean. If not, cook for another few minutes and check again. Leave to cool for 15 mins, then remove from the tin and leave to cool completely on a wire rack for around 45 mins. Spread the icing over the top, grate over a little more nutmeg, if you like, and decorate with the remaining pecans."
