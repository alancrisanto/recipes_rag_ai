If the dough rips, return the dough to the mixer.",

      "Once the dough is ready, shape it into a ball, then put in a buttered bowl, cover and leave to rise in a warm place for 1-2 hrs until doubled in size. When the dough has about 30 mins left, steep the teabag in 150ml boiling water, if using, then add the raisins and sultanas. Set aside.",

      "To make the chocolate dipping sauce, put all the chopped chocolate, the cinnamon, ginger and a small pinch of salt in a heatproof bowl. Pour the milk, cream and golden syrup into a small saucepan and heat until steaming. Pour this over the chopped chocolate mixture and whisk until it's smooth and glossy. You can loosen it by warming in the microwave if it sets.",
      "When the doughnuts are nearly ready, fill a large, deep saucepan with vegetable oil, ensuring it's no more than a third full, and heat to 160C-170C, or until a cube of bread dropped in browns in 30 seconds. Pipe a cross on each doughnut, then gently lower the doughnuts into the oil, trying to get them cross-side down first. You will need to do this in batches. Cook on each side for 3-4 mins, or until deep golden and cooked through. Remove to a sheet of kitchen paper using a slotted spoon. Toss the cooked doughnuts in 75g caster sugar in a bowl, then serve with the chocolate dipping sauce.The doughnuts are best eaten on the day they're made."

Add the maple syrup, vanilla extract and a pinch of salt, stir to combine and take off the heat. Use an electric whisk to transform the mixture into a silky smooth ganache, about 2-3 mins. Transfer to a piping bag and put in the fridge to cool.",
      "To make the sponge, sift all the dry ingredients (flour, cocoa powder, caster sugar, baking powder, cornflour, bicarbonate of soda and ½ tsp salt) together in a mixing bowl. In a small jug, combine the oat milk and vinegar to create a vegan buttermilk. Set aside.",

Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl of dry ingredients and use large metal spoon to combine until you have a thick batter. Stir a third of the whipped aquafaba into the batter. Once the batter has loosened slightly, tip the chocolate batter into the bowl with the remaining aquafaba and fold through until combined, being careful not to knock too much air from the mixture. Pour this into the prepared baking tin, level out with a spatula, and bake for 20-22 mins.",
      "Leave the sponge in the tin to cool for 5 mins before turning it out onto a large piece of parchment dusted with 1 tbsp icing sugar. Peel off the top parchment used to line the tin and leave for a further 2-3 mins to cool slightly. While still slightly warm, use the baking parchment to roll the sponge from the short end, creating a log. Carefully unroll and allow to cool completely – rolling the sponge while slightly warm helps prevent large cracks. But don’t worry if there are small cracks as they’ll be hidden by the ganache.",
      "For the filling, whisk the icing sugar, vanilla extract and plant-based double cream in a bowl until soft peaks have formed. The sponge should now be cool. Spread an even layer of the cream over the flat sponge. Then, as before, roll the filled sponge into a log and use the baking parchment to hold in a log shape. Transfer to a plate or board and into the fridge for 30 mins-1 hr.",
      "When you are ready to decorate, carefully unwrap the yule log from the parchment. Snip the end of the piping bag and pipe thick horizontal lines to cover the sponge with chocolate ganache. Use a spoon to create a soft pillowy finish to the ganache, or a fork to create a bark-like effect. Finish with any accompanying decorations – berries, edible holly décor or a spritz of gold spray. Transfer to the fridge for at least 1 hr or until you’re ready to serve.",

      "For the vanilla cookie dough, sift the flour into a mixing bowl. Add the sugar, vanilla and butter. Using an electric whisk or stand mixer, beat everything for 5 mins, until it resembles fine breadcrumbs. You can also do this in a food processor. Crack in the egg and beat again until it comes together into a dough. Bringtogether into a disc and set aside in the fridge to rest for at least 1 hr.",
      "For the chocolate cookies, sift the flour and cocoa powder into the same bowl and stir in the sugar, vanilla and butter. Beat using the electric whisk or stand mixer, for 5 mins, until it resembles fine breadcrumbs. You can also do this in a food processor. Crack in the egg and beat again. Bring together into a disc and set aside in the fridge to rest for at least 1 hr.",
      "Line two large baking trays with baking parchment. Lightly flour a clean work surface and roll out both doughs until 5mm thick. Using 4-6cm sized Easter cutters, stamp out the biscuits and arrange on the baking trays well spaced apart, then chill for at least 30 mins. Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Bake for 8-10 mins until golden. Leave to cool completely on the tray.",
      "To make the glaze, sift the icing sugar into a stand mixer bowl. Pour in the egg whites and 2 tbsp cold water. Using a paddle attachment, beat for 10 mins on the lowest setting until firm and thickened. Divide between three bowls and stir a different colouring paste into each one. Take 3 tbsp of each colour and pour into three piping bags. These will be used for outline and decoration. Loosen the rest of the icing with 1-2 tsp of water in a each bowl, stirring until smooth. If you draw a spoon through to the base of the bowl, the icing should merge again after 4 seconds.",
      "Pipe each cookie with an outline, then once set (after about 30 mins), spoon the liquid icing into the middle and carefully spread out using the back of a teaspoon. Leave to set for 2 hrs. Decorate with further icing on top, such as lines or flowers and leave to set for 30 mins."

      "Melt the butter in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over a medium heat (use a light-coloured saucepan, if possible, so you can easily see when the butter has browned). The butter will start to foam, but continue cooking, stirring often, until you see golden-brown specks form at the base of the pan, about 5-7 mins. Watch closely, as the butter can burn easily. As soon as the butter is golden brown and smells nutty, remove from the heat and pour into a heatproof container or bowl. Leave to cool to room temperature.",
      "Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Whisk the flour, baking powder and a pinch of salt together, then set aside. Combine the eggs, sugar, honey and vanilla in a large bowl, then gently fold in the dry ingredients, adding about half the dry mixture at a time. Finally, fold in the milk and the cooled brown butter.",
      "Line a 20 x 20cm square baking tin with baking parchment, then tip in the sponge batter, level the surface using a spatula or the back of a spoon and bake for 30-35 mins, or until a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean. Leave to cool in the tin for a few minutes, then remove to a wire rack to cool completely. Once fully cooled, cut the cake into roughly 3.5cm cubes using a sharp bread knife (you should get around 25 total).",
      "For the coating, combine the melted butter and milk in a shallow bowl, then sift in the cocoa powder, icing sugar and a pinch of salt, then mix until smooth. Tip the coconut into a second shallow bowl or dish. Dip the cake cubes into the chocolate coating using two forks, making sure to coat all sides evenly, then immediately toss in the coconut, ensuring all sides are fully coated. Transfer the coated cake cubes to a wire rack set over a tray, then transfer to the fridge to set for 10 mins before serving.Will keep in an airtight container for up to five days."
