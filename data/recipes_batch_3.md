Toss the noodles with the beansprouts, carrots, green beans, green parts of the spring onions and most of the reserved coriander leaves.The dressing can be made up to two days ahead and kept chilled, and the salad ingredients can be tossed together then covered and chilled the day before.
- To cook the pork patties, heat thebarbecueuntil the coals are glowing orange with a grey ash on them. Drizzle and rub the patties with a little oil, then cook them on the bars of the barbecue for 4-5 mins on each side, until lightly charred and cooked all the way through. While the pork is cooking, drizzle the noodles and veg with most of the dressing and toss until everything is coated, then pile onto a platter. Lift the patties off the barbecue straight onto the noodles, drizzle with the rest of the dressing, scatter with the rest of the coriander and the peanuts. Serve with sweet chilli sauce on the side, if you like.

- First make the chilli. Heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat, crumble in the mince and fry for 15-20 mins. At first, it will release some liquid, but once that has bubbled away, the mince will sizzle in its own fat and start to brown and crisp. At this point, break it up using a wooden spoon so it browns and caramelises all over, then stir in the onion and cook for another 10 mins until the onion has softened. Add the garlic, chipotle paste, spice mix, sugar, and vinegar, and cook for 1 min. Tip in the beans and tomatoes, give everything a stir and simmer, uncovered, for 20 mins until thickened.Will keep chilled for two days or frozen for a month. Defrost throughly and reheat until piping hot.
- Meanwhile, put the rice in a mediumsaucepanwith 600ml cold water and a pinch of salt, if you like. Bring to the boil, then turn the heat down low, cover and gently simmer for about 20 mins until all the water has been absorbed. Turn off the heat and leave for another 10 mins undisturbed. Stir the rice and leave to stand.
- For the guacamole, mix the tomatoes with the onion, coriander, lime juice and some seasoning, then mash to make a chunky guacamole. To serve, warm the tortillas, roughly spread over some of the guacamole, add a generous layer of rice, then the chilli, natural yogurt, lime juice and grated cheddar, if you like. Wrap everything up tight and halve through the middle and serve.

## Next level focaccia
**Link:** https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/next-level-focaccia

**Description:** Set aside time for a bit of kitchen therapy and bake this classic Italian bread for a savoury treat. It's best eaten straightaway, but will keep for two days

**Prep Time:** 25 mins

**Cook Time:** 50 mins

**Difficulty:** More effort

**Serves:** Serves 12

**Diet Type:** Dairy-free

### Nutrition Information

- **carbs:** 38g
- **sugars:** 0.3g
- **fibre:** 2g
- **protein:** 7g
- **salt:** 1.3g

### Ingredients
- 200gstrong white bread flour
- ½ x 7g sachetfast-action dried yeast
- For the preferment
- 200gstrong white bread flour
- ½ x 7g sachetfast-action dried yeast
- 400gstrong white bread flour
- ½ x 7g sachetfast-action dried yeast
- 10gfine salt
- 100mlolive oil
- 1garlic bulb
- 2rosemary sprigs, leaves picked
- 1 tspsea salt flakes
- For the dough
- 400gstrong white bread flour
- ½ x 7g sachetfast-action dried yeast
- 10gfine salt
- 100mlolive oil
- 1garlic bulb
- 2rosemary sprigs, leaves picked
- 1 tspsea salt flakes

### Method
- To make the preferment, mix the flour with the yeast and 200g room temperature water in a small bowl.Cover the bowl and leave to ferment for 12-24 hrs. Don’t worry about it bubbling up and coming down again – this is just about creating flavour.
- For the dough, tip the preferment into a large bowl and pour over 225g tepid water. Stir with aspatulato combine. Tip in the flour and the rest of the yeast and mix everything together to make a rough dough. Make sure all the flour is mixed in and that there are no dry bits on the side of the bowl. Cover and leave to rest for at least 30 mins or up to 1 hr.
- Scatter the fine salt over the dough, dip a hand into water and scrunch the salt through the dough to mix it in completely. Cover again and leave for 20-30 mins.
- Wet your hands, grab the dough from one side and stretch it back over itself. Repeat with the other side – it should be very elastic. Curl the dough around itself so that it’s smooth and taught, then cover and leave for another 20-30 mins. Repeat this process twice more, then cover and leave to prove for 2-3 hrs until risen by about 40 per cent – the dough should be bubbly and soft.
- Drizzle a deep, roughly 20 x 30cm baking tray with 2 tbsp of the olive oil and scrape the dough onto the tray. Incorporate the oil into the dough by stretching and folding it on the tray. Don’t worry if it’s a bit stringy to start, keep stretching and bringing it back on itself. When the dough has come together and is oily, cover and leave to prove at room temperature for 2 hrs, or for a much better flavour, up to 48 hrs in the fridge. Remove from the fridge 1 hr before baking.
- Heat the oven to 230C/210C fan/gas 7. Meanwhile, cut the top off the head of garlic to expose the cloves. Sit the garlic on a piece of foil, drizzle with 1 tsp of the olive oil and season with salt. Wrap the bulb in the foil to create a parcel, put on a tray and roast for 25 mins. Remove from the oven and leave until cool enough to handle, then slip the garlic cloves out from their skins – they don’t need to be completely soft at this point.
- Use your fingers to stretch the dough so it fits into the tray evenly, then dimple the surface using your fingertips. Push the garlic cloves and rosemary leaves deeply into the dough, evenly spaced apart. Drizzle with 1 tbsp olive oil and dimple a few more times to create oil puddles on the surface. Scatter over the 1 tsp sea salt flakes, give the dough a final poke and bake for 25-30 mins until puffed up and deep golden. Remove from the oven, drizzle with the remaining olive oil then leave to cool for at least 40 mins before cutting and serving.Best eaten straightaway, but will keep for two days in an airtight container.
