- Remove the chips to a wire rack lined with kitchen paper and leave to drain. Heat the oil to 180C – it’s hot enough when a cube of bread turns brown within 15 seconds – then cook the chips for 4-5 mins more until crisp and golden. Remove to awire racklined with fresh kitchen paper, then tip into a bowl and season with 1½ tsp salt and the paprika.
- Put the flour and cornflour in a bowl and season well with salt and a pinch of white pepper. Turn the fish pieces in the mixture, one by one, until completely coated.
- Fry for 4-6 mins, with the oil still at 180C, until golden and crisp. You may need to do this in batches, keeping the cooked fish warm in a low oven as you go. Serve with lemon wedges for squeezing over.

### Ingredients
- 100gunsalted butter
- 100gdark chocolate,chopped into small pieces
- 100gmarshmallows(vegetarian, if needed)
- 125gcrispy rice cereal
- 397gcan condensed milk
- 100gunsalted butter
- 100glight brown soft sugar
- For the caramel layer
- 397gcan condensed milk
- 100gunsalted butter
- 100glight brown soft sugar
- 300gwhite chocolate,broken into pieces
- a mixture of food colouring gels(we used pink, yellow, green and blue)
- mini chocolate eggs,to decorate (optional)
- For the topping
- 300gwhite chocolate,broken into pieces
- a mixture of food colouring gels(we used pink, yellow, green and blue)
- mini chocolate eggs,to decorate (optional)

### Method
- Line a 20cm square cake tin with baking parchment. Tip the butter, dark chocolate and marshmallows into asaucepanover a low heat and warm for 2-3 mins, stirring occasionally until melted together. Watch closely to ensure the mixture doesn’t catch. Remove from the heat and leave to cool for a few minutes.
- Tip the cereal into a large bowl and pour over the warm melted chocolate mixture. Stir well with a siliconespatulauntil all the cereal is coated. Tip the mixture into the prepared tin and use the back of a spoon to press it firmly into the base and sides. Put in the fridge while you prepare the caramel layer.
- For the caramel, pour the condensed milk into a deep saucepan along with the butter and sugar. Warm over a low heat, stirring with a spatula until the butter has melted. Turn the heat up to medium and simmer for 5-10 mins until the mixture thickens and turns golden – when it’s ready, a line should form when you run your spatula along the base. (Don’t worry if there are some darker specks, just keep stirring the caramel so it doesn’t burn.) Pour the caramel over the cereal base and smooth the surface. Chill for at least 1 hr until set.
- Melt the white chocolate in a heatproof bowl in themicrowavein 5-second blasts (about 1-2 mins total), stirring halfway through. Or, do this over a pan of simmering water, ensuring the base of the bowl doesn’t touch the water. Divide the melted chocolate between five bowls. Leave one bowl plain, then colour the remaining four bowls with a few drops of food colouring each. (We chose pale yellow, blue, green and pink.) If the chocolate starts to set as you’re mixing in the colours, return it to the microwave for about 30 seconds.
- Alternately spoon dollops of the coloured and plain white chocolate over the set caramel layer. Shake the tin gently until the surface is smooth. Use a skewer to gently swirl the chocolate to create a marbled effect, then scatter over the chocolate eggs and chill for 1 hr until set. Remove from the tin and cut into nine larger or 16 smaller squares.

- **sugars:** 13g
- **fibre:** 3g
- **protein:** 33g
- **salt:** 0.7g

### Ingredients
- 2 tbspsunflower oil
- 1 kgbrisket beef(any kitchen string removed)
- 2onions,chopped
- 4garlic cloves,finely grated
- 1 tbspground coriander
- 1 tbspground cumin
- 1 tbspsmoked paprika
- 1 tspchilli powder(optional)
- 1 tbspmustard powder
- 30glight muscovado sugar
- 100mlred wine vinegar
- 100mltomato ketchup
- 500mlbeef stock
- soft bunsand coleslaw, to serve

### Method
- Heat the oven to 150C/130C fan/ gas 2. Heat 1 tbsp of the oil in a flameproof casserole over a medium heat. Season the beef well and sear for 10-15 mins until browned all over. Lift out onto a plate. Add another 1 tbsp oil and the onions to the pan, and cook for 8-10 mins until soft. Add the garlic and cook for a minute more, then scatter in the spices and mustard powder to make a paste.
- Stir in the sugar, then add the vinegar and bubble for a few minutes before adding the ketchup and stock. Give everything a good stir and bring to a simmer. Return the beef to the pan and spoon over the sauce. Cover the pan tightly with foil, then the lid, and transfer to the oven for 4 hrs.
- Remove the dish from the oven and check the meat. Sometimes brisket is ready in 4 hrs, but it can take up to 6 hrs, so push into the meat with a fork – if it feels like it can be pulled apart, it’s ready, but if not, turn the beef over, stir the sauce, cover with the foil and lid again, and cook for another hour, or until fork-tender and easily shredded. If the sauce is too thick and starting to catch, add a splash of water.
- Leave the beef to cool slightly in the sauce – it’s fine to leave the fat in the sauce, but some of it can be spooned off, if you like. Use two forks to shred the beef into the sauce and mix gently until evenly coated. Serve in the casserole, ready to be stuffed into buns with coleslaw.Once completely cool, the beef will keep chilled for up to three days or frozen for three months. Defrost fully in the fridge overnight before reheating over a low heat until piping hot.

- **carbs:** 62g
- **sugars:** 30g
- **fibre:** 2g
- **protein:** 9g
- **salt:** 0.6g

### Ingredients
- 500gstrong white bread flour,plus extra for dusting
- 7gsachet fast-action dried yeast
- 3½ tbspgolden caster sugar
- 50gdried blueberries(optional)
- 250mlwhole milk
- 2eggs,beaten
- 50gunsalted butter,cut into cubes and softened
- 275gsoft cheese,at room temperature
- sunflower oil,for the bowl and tin
- 1 tbsphoney
- 350gblueberries
- 225ggolden caster sugar
- 1lemon,juiced
- For the jam
- 350gblueberries
- 225ggolden caster sugar
- 1lemon,juiced

### Method
- To make the dough, put the flour, yeast, 2 tbsp sugar and 1 tsp fine sea salt in the bowl of astand mixerfitting with a dough hook. Stir well to combine. Tip in the dried blueberries, if using, the milk and most of the egg, reserving 1-2 tbsp. Knead on medium for 8-10 mins until the dough is elastic and smooth. Add the butter, cube by cube, until no streaks remain, only adding more once the previous addition has been completely incorporated. Add 50g of the soft cheese in the same way, mixing in a little at a time until fully incorporated. Continue kneading until the dough comes away cleanly from the bowl. This whole process will take 8-10 mins, and when ready, the dough will be soft and tacky. Form into a ball and transfer to a lightly oiled bowl. Cover and prove in the fridge overnight (at least 12 hrs).
- Meanwhile, if you’re making the jam, tip the blueberries, sugar and lemon juice into a deepsaucepanand bring to a simmer over a medium heat. Cook for 15-20 mins, stirring occasionally and mashing the blueberries with the spoon until thickened and reduced. Set aside to cool completely.Will keep for a week in a sterilised jar in the fridge.
- Oil a 27x14cm (or 2kg) loaf tin and line with baking parchment. Mix the remaining soft cheese with the rest of the sugar. Beat the jam well to loosen, adding 1 tsp boiling water if it’s very stiff. Tip the proved dough onto a lightly dusted work surface and roll out into a roughly 60 x 30cm rectangle. Spread over the rest of the soft cheese, leaving a 1-2cm border around the edges, then spoon the blueberry jam on top. Roll up into a tight spiral from a long side, tucking the seam underneath. Cut the spiral in half lengthways, so you have two long pieces parallel to each other. Carefully plait the pieces together, cut-sides up, and lay in the tin, gently tucking both ends in. Cover. Leave to prove in a warm place for 30 mins-1 hr until doubled in size.
- Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/ gas 4. Brush the babka with the remaining egg and bake for 30 mins until deeply golden. Cover loosely with foil, turn the oven up to 200C/180C fan/gas 5 and bake for a further 30-45 mins until the base sounds hollow when tapped. Brush with the honey and cool in the tin for 30 mins before turning out onto awire rackto cool completely. Slice to serve.Best eaten the day it’s made, but it will keep in an airtight container for two days.

Remove to a plate using a slotted spoon and set aside. Fry the chicken for 5-6 mins until browned but not cooked all the way through. You may need to do this in batches. Remove with the slotted spoon and set aside with the chorizo.
- Add the onions and peppers to the pan and cook, stirring often for 6-8 mins until softened and starting to lightly brown. Use a wooden spoon to scrape up any caramelised bits on the bottom and mix them in. Stir in the fajita seasoning and cook for 30 seconds before returning the chorizo and chicken to the pan.
- Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and give everything a good stir. Tip in the pinto beans and potatoes, stir to coat well, then pour in the stock, topping up with water if it doesn’t cover the chicken and veg. Bring to a simmer, reduce the heat a little and put the lid on. Simmer gently for 10 mins. Give everything a stir, then sit the corn on the cobs on top.
- Return the lid to the pan and cook for a further 15 mins. Serve in large bowls, each topped with a spoonful of soured cream and a scattering of chopped parsley, if you like.

## Ultimate vanilla ice cream

**Prep Time:** 2 hrs

**Cook Time:** No Cook Time

**Difficulty:** Easy

**Serves:** 8 big scoops

**Diet Type:** Freezable

### Nutrition Information

- **saturates:** 12g
- **carbs:** 18g
- **sugars:** 15g
- **fibre:** 0g
- **protein:** 3g
- **salt:** 0.1g

### Ingredients
- 284mlcarton double cream
- 300mlfull fat milk
- 115ggolden caster sugar
- 1vanilla pod
- 3large free-range egg yolks
- have lots of ice cubesat the ready

### Method
- Put the canister from the machine into the freezer a day before you want to make the ice cream. Next day, pour the cream and milk into a medium heavy-based pan, then tip in half the sugar. Slit the vanilla pod down its length with a small sharp knife and scoop out as many of the tiny black seeds as you can into the cream mixture. Cut the pod into three and drop it into the pan.
- Heat the cream and milk over a low heat, stirring occasionally, until it almost boils – you’ll see a few bubbles at the edge. Take off the heat and set aside for 30 minutes so the vanilla can infuse.
- Put the egg yolks into a bowl with the rest of the sugar and beat with an electric hand beater for about 2 minutes until the mixture has thickened, is paler in colour and falls in thick ribbons when you lift the beaters. Using a measuring jug, scoop out about 125ml/4fl oz of the cream mixture and beat into the egg yolks to slacken them. Reheat the cream until it just comes to the boil, take off the heat and stir in the egg yolk mixture.
- Return the pan to a low heat and cook, stirring all the time with a wooden spoon, for 8-10 minutes, until the custard is thick enough to coat the back of the spoon. Watch that it doesn’t boil – as soon as you see any bubbles about to burst to the surface, it should be thick enough, so take the pan off the heat so the mixture doesn’t curdle.
- Pour the custard into a heatproof bowl, then sit it in a bigger bowl one third full of iced water to cool (this takes about 20 minutes). Stir occasionally to stop a skin forming. Put the bowl of custard in the fridge for 3-4 hours, preferably overnight, so it gets really cold.
- Get the ice cream machine running, scoop out the vanilla pod pieces, then slowly pour in the cold custard. Leave it to churn for 10-30 minutes (depending on your machine). When it stops, it is probably too soft to eat, so spoon into a plastic container, cover with cling film, then a lid, and freeze for a minimum of 3 hours. (It will keep in the freezer for 3 months but don’t take it out, then refreeze.) Remove from the freezer 15 minutes before serving.
- To make it by hand: in step 1, heat the milk, vanilla, and half the sugar without the cream (the custard will be slightly thicker). At the start of step 6, whip the cream so it’s light and floppy, not too stiff, and fold it into the cold custard. Freeze for 3-4 hours, stirring once an hour until almost frozen, then freeze as above.
